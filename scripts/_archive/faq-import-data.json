    "question": "Is Islay worth visiting?",
    "answer": "If you value whisky, wildlife, dramatic landscapes and island pace over easy access, absolutely. Ten world-class distilleries, 30,000+ winter geese, empty beaches, and genuine remoteness. Not for those wanting quick getaways - the journey is part of the experience.",

    "answer": "If you want genuine remoteness - yes. One road, one hotel, one pub, 6,000+ red deer to ~200 people. It makes Islay feel busy.
