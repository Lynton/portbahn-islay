=== BLOCK: About Us ===
We're Pi and Lynton, and we've been welcoming guests to Islay since 2017. We started by letting out our own family home, Portbahn House, and now manage three properties in Bruichladdich — each one with its own story and character.

Portbahn House was our family home for years. Our books are still on the shelves, our children's games still in the cupboards. Shorefield is the Jacksons' creation — they built it with love, planted every tree, created the bird hides, and filled it with their art, books and curios from their travels. Curlew Cottage is our friend Alan's family holiday getaway, now opening to guests for the first time.

These aren't purpose-built holiday lets — they're real family homes with personality. We manage them the way we'd want our own homes looked after: with care, attention, and a genuine interest in making your stay really memorable.

We now live on Jura (one more ferry away!), where we built Bothan Jura Retreat from scratch — the kind of place we'd want to escape to ourselves. A hot tub in each space at the foot of the Paps, under the stars.

We've raised our two children here on the islands, so we know what a special place this is for families. We know the beaches, the walks, the rainy day escapes, the wildlife moments that stick with you. We love to share all of it.

We try to create the sort of places we like to stay when we go away — a genuine home from home. That's always been our philosophy, and guests tell us it comes through in the way we manage our properties and communicate throughout the booking process and help with any problems.

If you have any questions about Islay, Jura, our properties, or anything else — just get in touch. We love helping guests plan their trips.

Pi, Lynton and Amba

=== BLOCK: Barnacle Geese on Islay ===
Islay is exceptional for wildlife and particularly known for its birdwatching. Although you can spot a huge array of bird life all year round, timing can be everything!

Barnacle Geese

Over 30,000 barnacle geese arrive from Greenland each October, spending winter on Islay before returning north in April. RSPB Loch Gruinart reserve is the best viewing location — the morning flights as thousands of geese lift from the loch are spectacular. The sound is unforgettable.

If you're visiting between October and April, witnessing the geese is a highlight. Arrive at Loch Gruinart at dawn for the best show. Guests who've experienced this consistently describe it as one of their trip highlights. The local farmers, however, are a bit less enthusiastic — they can decimate crops!

Eagles

Islay has both golden eagles and white-tailed sea eagles — two of Scotland's most magnificent raptors. Keep an eye out for them over moorland, coastal cliffs, and inland hills. Sea eagles are enormous with wingspans up to 8 feet. If you see something huge gliding overhead, it's likely a sea eagle. A good check is "does it look like a barn door?" — their square-ended wing profile is quite distinctive.

We keep binoculars in all our properties, and guests regularly spot eagles from the houses or during coastal walks.

Seals, Otters & Marine Life

Common seals and grey seals frequent Loch Indaal and coastal areas. Guests spot seals from our property windows regularly — sometimes they're visible from the breakfast table at Portbahn House. Otters are shyer but present along quiet shorelines. Your best chance is early morning or dusk along the coast. Meandering along the stretch of coast that runs alongside the Bruichladdich–Port Charlotte cycle path is a lovely way to wildlife spot.

Dolphins and porpoises also occasionally visit Loch Indaal. We've had guests see them from Portbahn House and Shorefield's windows — it's rare but magical when it happens. Minke whales and basking sharks can sometimes be seen offshore in summer months.

RSPB Reserves

RSPB Loch Gruinart — Flagship reserve for geese, waders, raptors. Also has a nature trail and woods to explore.

RSPB The Oa — Cliffs, choughs, seabirds, dramatic coastal scenery.

Both reserves are free to visit with hides, trails, and visitor information. Bring binoculars (essential for birding), a camera with zoom lens, and warm layers for dawn/dusk watching.

=== BLOCK: Beaches Overview ===
Islay's coastline is peppered with dozens of beaches, some sheltered, some ferocious — and you'll often have miles of sand entirely to yourselves. These are some of our favourites and the ones guests ask about most:

Safe Swimming Beaches

Portbahn Beach — Our hidden gem, 5-minute walk, 3 tiny sheltered coves, safe swimming, rock pools at low tide

Port Charlotte Beach — 5-minute drive, family-friendly, shallow, sandy, ice cream in the village after

Laggan Bay / Airport Beach — Long, shallow, sandy, safe for swimming

Kilnaughton Bay — Near Port Ellen, family-friendly, shallow, safe

Dramatic Atlantic Beaches (NOT safe for swimming)

Machir Bay — Islay's most famous, 2 miles of golden sand backed by dunes, dramatic Atlantic surf and stunning sunsets. Head northwards up the coast towards Opera House Rocks for expansive skies, crashing waves and eagles for company. Or head south and walk over the top to the old ruined chapel at Kilchiaran. Spectacular for walks — but DANGEROUS currents.

Saligo Bay — Dramatic Atlantic, stunning but NOT safe for swimming

Sanaigmore — Dramatic stretch of northern coast with great rock formations for playing hide and seek. There's also a lovely small art gallery nearby serving coffee and cakes.

Ardnave Point — Rolling dunes perfect for kids running full pelt, big skies and empty beaches. Combine with a roam through the nature trail and woods at nearby RSPB Loch Gruinart.

Hidden Beaches on Islay

Singing Sands — Beautiful remote beach worth the walk. The sand squeaks underfoot — kids love it.

Claggain Bay — Secluded, with a lovely coastal walk to reach it. Rarely visited.

Port Ellen town beach — Convenient if you're arriving by the southern ferry or combining with a south coast distillery day.

CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING: Machir Bay, Saligo Bay, and Sanaigmore are not safe for swimming. Strong currents, undertows, and cold Atlantic conditions make these "drowning beaches" as locals call them. There have been a number of close calls over the years. Admire them, walk them, photograph them — but don't enter the water. And remember, the RNLI and coastguard who'll come to rescue you are volunteers!

For actual swimming, stick to Loch Indaal beaches (Portbahn, Port Charlotte) or the southeast coast (Laggan Bay, Kilnaughton). Either embrace the cold water (it really is good for you — we love it!), or bring a wetsuit if you're planning any proper open water swimming. The water is cold year-round (10-14°C), and wetsuits make wild swimming more comfortable for longer splashing about. For coastal walks to reach the best beaches, see the walking guide.

=== BLOCK: Bothan Jura Retreat ===
We also own and manage Bothan Jura Retreat on Jura — a passion project we built from scratch from an acre of bog and an old ruined cottage. We created it as the kind of place we'd want to escape to ourselves.

The Accommodation

Mrs Leonard's Cottage — Old stone renovated cotters' cottage, sleeps 2. The original cottage that has sat here for over a century, braced against the Hebridean squalls and winters, now restored to snug comfort.

The Rusty Hut Lodge — Cosy corten steel and timber, sleeps 2. Clad in beautiful rusted Corten steel like the old farm buildings around Knockrome; the old boards from Southport Pier line one wall, with oak floorboards on the floor.

The Black Hut Cabin — Contemporary minimalist space, sleeps 2. Birch plywood simplicity with a handmade kitchen by our Welsh joiner Shaun.

The Shepherd's Hut — Off-grid glamping, sleeps 2.

Each unit is designed for couples or solo travellers seeking genuine remoteness and has its own wood-fired hot tub. Mrs Leonard's Cottage also has a sauna.

The Experience

Hot tub under the stars at the foot of the Paps

Sauna to warm up after wild swimming or hill walking

Fire pit for evening relaxation

Location — Dramatic landscape, red deer wandering past, the Paps towering above, Corran Sands at the bottom of the drive

Character

We've built Bothan Jura Retreat over eight years with a lot of love and time and passion. We live here too. These are places we'd want to stay.

If you want wilderness and enjoy attention to detail — cosy but wild — you'll probably love it here. We've tried to make this place a part of ourselves: simple, beautiful, contemporary accommodation in one of Scotland's most remote landscapes.

Getting There

To get to Jura takes two ferries from the mainland (first to Islay, then to Jura), or fly to Islay then ferry. The journey is absolutely part of the experience and that final 5-minute leg on the wee ferry always feels special.

From March to the end of September the Jura Passenger Ferry also runs twice daily directly between Tayvallich on the mainland and Craighouse on Jura.

If Islay fills up or you're looking for even more remoteness, or an experience of two very different islands, consider splitting your trip between both islands. Get in touch and we'll help you create an Islay-Jura multi-island trip.

=== BLOCK: Bruichladdich Proximity ===
The village of Bruichladdich, dominated by its progressive Bruichladdich Distillery, sits on the western shore of Loch Indaal on the Rhinns of Islay, a fifteen-minute drive from Islay's main centre of Bowmore.

The Rhinns has a character all of its own and is geologically completely different to the rest of Islay — part of the land mass connected to South America, comprised primarily of incredibly ancient gneiss rock, with a fault line running the centre of Loch Indaal through Loch Gruinart. Earthquakes are frequent, though rarely felt!

We love this part of Islay, from Bridgend Woods, down through the pretty harbour villages of Port Charlotte and Portnahaven at the tip, to the dramatic west coast beaches and rock formations at Machir Bay, Saligo and Sanaigmore.

The village is a great base to explore everything the island offers. You're a scenic 5-minute walk to Bruichladdich Distillery along the coastal cycle path — tour the distillery, sample world-renowned, record-breaking single malts and, of course, The Botanist gin, then walk home.

The coastal location of our houses gives immediate access to Portbahn Beach just down from the war memorial — one of Islay's hidden gems with three sheltered bays perfect for wild swimming, rock pooling, and coastal ambling.

It's also just a 5-minute drive or 40-minute walk from Port Charlotte village, perhaps Islay's prettiest, with two outstanding pubs/hotels with excellent local food and extensive whisky selections — The Port Charlotte Hotel and Lochindaal Seafood Kitchen. There's also the fascinating Museum of Islay Life about the history of the island, a local shop, post office and petrol station, and the children's playground at Port Mor.

From Here, Everything's Reachable

From Bruichladdich, all ten of Islay's whisky distilleries are within easy reach. The island's renowned beaches — Machir Bay to Saligo Bay to the dunes at Ardnave Point — offer miles of golden sand and dramatic Atlantic surf. RSPB Loch Gruinart provides exceptional birdwatching, with over 30,000 barnacle geese arriving each winter from Greenland. The countryside is perfect for hiking and wildlife spotting, from golden eagles to seals.

Bruichladdich's central west coast location on the Rhinns makes it an ideal base for experiencing the very best of island life on Islay — but from a different angle than the ferry ports.

=== BLOCK: Ferry Basics ===
Travel to Islay is not straightforward. You don't come to the Scottish islands if you want easy! You come because of the adventure and for an experience you can't get on the mainland.

Make the journey part of the experience. Twenty minutes outside Glasgow, after you pass Dumbarton, you're at Loch Lomond and from there you have two hours of some of the most beautiful scenery on earth, followed by a two-hour ferry journey to unwind.

We now live on Jura (a second ferry journey away!), but lived on Islay for a few years before that. We're very familiar with all the ins and outs of getting on and off the islands and dodging winter storms or summer rushes. We've been helping hundreds of guests make their trip successfully since we first let out our own home, Portbahn House, in 2017 — so if you have any questions or fears, do just get in touch.

By Ferry from Kennacraig

The Isle of Islay is accessible by CalMac ferry from Kennacraig on the Kintyre Peninsula to two ports — Port Ellen (2 hours 20 minutes) and Port Askaig (2 hours). Both ports are approximately 30-40 minutes' drive from our Bruichladdich properties. You have to book a ferry to a specific port rather than just to "Islay" — which port will depend on what time you're travelling. The crossing offers beautiful views across the Sound of Jura.

Vehicle reservations are absolutely essential and should be booked up to 12 weeks in advance, especially during peak season and Fèis Ìle (the whisky festival) in late May. We can't emphasise this enough. Book your ferry as soon as you book your accommodation if you can.

A really important note: if there isn't the exact crossing you want, book the closest you can — ferry bookings change daily and if you have enough time before you travel you'll almost certainly be able to change it. But get a reservation in the system!

Which Port to Choose?

Port Askaig is marginally closer to Bruichladdich (25 minutes vs 40 minutes from Port Ellen), but both routes work equally well and the choice of port will be dictated by the sailing times, so don't worry overly. Check which sailing times suit your schedule — Port Ellen and Port Askaig ferries operate on different timetables throughout the day.

By Air from Glasgow

Loganair operates daily flights from Glasgow to Islay Airport, with the flight taking approximately 25 minutes. Two flights typically operate daily (one on weekends), first thing in the morning and at around 5pm. Islay Airport is 30 minutes' drive from our properties. This option suits travellers preferring speed over scenery, though the ferry crossing itself is such a special part of the island experience.

While the ferries are disrupted by wind, it's low cloud that disrupts the flights. Islay Airport doesn't have the radar required to allow landing in poor visibility — the pilots must be able to see the runway clearly. A general rule of thumb: if you can see the other side of Loch Indaal, the plane can land. If you can't, it won't! This can mean some strategic planning — low cloud, get the ferry; high winds, take the plane. If you're not sure, get in touch and we'll help.

What to Expect on the Crossing

Arrive at Kennacraig ferry terminal at least 30-45 minutes before departure or you risk being placed in the standby queue — they are strict! Once you drive onto the ferry, leave your car and head upstairs to the passenger lounges — you cannot remain in your vehicle during the crossing. Pets are allowed aboard on the passenger deck.

Foot passengers, head to the main CalMac office or see one of the stewards who will point you towards the ramp onto the ferry.

The ferry has an excellent restaurant serving really good quality hot food, locally sourced wherever possible (including Jura's own Kirsty's pies!), along with basic snacks and drinks (including Islay whisky and gin of course). We always plan to have our main meal on the ferry home!

Most guests find the crossing relaxing rather than rough. If it's very rough they don't sail. On clear days, views of the Paps of Jura and the Kintyre coastline are spectacular — you pass by Gigha, and it's not uncommon to spot seals, occasionally dolphins, and you regularly see the giant Lion's Mane jellyfish from the deck. One guest recently said, "The crossing was part of the holiday" — something we hear quite often!

If you're prone to motion sickness, head out onto the deck and stare straight at the horizon — seems to work best! Or if you're inside, sit near the centre of the vessel on the lower passenger deck where movement and roll is minimised. Try to avoid reading or looking at screens — focus on the horizon instead, or close your eyes. The café sells basic remedies, but bring your own travel sickness pills (Stugeron, Kwells or Dramamine) if you want something stronger.

Planning Your Journey

Your journey to Islay typically represents a full travel day, so plan on that and enjoy it. From Glasgow, expect minimum 5-6 hours door-to-door via ferry (3 hours driving to Kennacraig + 2½-hour crossing + onward travel). Stop at Loch Lomond for a picnic, at Loch Fyne for seafood lunch (with an amazing garden centre and café next door!), or at historic Inveraray with its jail and castle.

We recommend treating your first and last days as travel days rather than packing in activities. A week-long stay gives you 5 genuine activity days. Our guests who book for 7+ nights consistently tell us they wish they'd had longer.

Book your CalMac ferry crossing at calmac.co.uk — vehicle reservations open up to 12 weeks ahead. Book as soon as your accommodation is confirmed.

=== BLOCK: Ferry Support ===
Don't panic — here's the reality: Because we live here, we know the ropes. We've helped dozens of guests navigate CalMac disruptions over the years. We hold a 5.0/5 communication rating on Airbnb, and 30+ reviews specifically mention our ferry crisis support! One guest wrote: "Pi looked after us like family during the ferry chaos." We've got you!

If your crossing is disrupted, you're not alone. But plan well ahead, watch the weather, get ferry alerts and stay in touch!

Why Cancellations Occur

Weather is the main culprit — wind gusts above 40-45mph can prevent safe boarding or crossing. CalMac also occasionally suspends sailings due to mechanical issues (the fleet is ageing) or industrial action. Winter months see more disruptions than summer, but cancellations can happen any time of year.

Be prepared: call ahead, keep an eye on the weather, and sign up for CalMac travel alerts.

What to Do If Your Ferry is Cancelled

CalMac will contact you via text or email if they cancel your sailing

Call CalMac immediately on 0800 066 5000 to rebook onto the next available sailing

Contact me — I can offer advice or flexible check-in arrangements and possibly additional accommodation if needed

Sign up for live updates by texting "calmac subscribe 09" to 60030 for ferry status alerts

Flexible Tickets

If you book "flexi" tickets (slightly more expensive than standard), you can change your sailing without penalty. This provides peace of mind if you're worried about disruption, particularly for winter bookings.

Travel Insurance

We very strongly recommend travel insurance that covers ferry cancellations. Weather disruptions are a part of island life. Check what your insurance protects regarding this and your accommodation costs if you cannot reach Islay on your planned dates. Most travel policies include "delayed departure" cover.

We cannot refund your accommodation costs if your ferry is disrupted or you miss it, unfortunately, so make sure you're properly covered!

Our Commitment

If ferry disruption affects your arrival or departure, contact me immediately. We can usually accommodate late arrivals or adjust check-out times, or even put you up at one of our other properties for an extra night. In 8+ years of hosting hundreds of guests, we've never had a booking completely collapse due to CalMac — there's always a solution, even if it means thinking outside the box!

=== BLOCK: Flights to Islay ===
Flight Details

Loganair operates two flights daily (one on Sundays) between Glasgow and Islay Airport. Flight time is approximately 25 minutes, with stunning aerial views of the islands on clear days. The aircraft are small (typically 20–30 passengers), and hand luggage space is limited. Check baggage allowances when booking.

Islay Airport

Islay Airport is one of Scotland's smallest and most scenic airports, located on the southern tip of the island. The airport terminal has limited facilities — essentially a single room with check-in desks. Don't expect shops or lounges, and sadly the café isn't running at the moment — there is just a vending machine once you are through security. But the experience is charming and efficient.

From Airport to Bruichladdich

The drive takes about 30 minutes via the A846 through Bowmore and around the head of Loch Indaal. Car hire is available at the airport through Islay Car Hire — book in advance, especially in summer. Taxis should also be pre-booked; there is no ready-to-go taxi rank. You must arrange onward travel in advance.

Cost Considerations

Flights are significantly more expensive than ferries, particularly if travelling as a family or with luggage — it averages £100+ per person each way. However, flying saves 4+ hours of travel time each way and avoids potential ferry disruptions. Many guests fly one direction and ferry the other to experience both.

Weather Considerations

While the ferries are disrupted by wind, it is low cloud that disrupts the flights. Islay Airport does not have the radar required to allow landing in poor visibility — the pilots must be able to see the runway clearly to land.

A general rule of thumb: if you can see the other side of Loch Indaal, the plane can land. If you can't, it won't. This can mean some strategic planning — low cloud, get the ferry; high winds, take the plane. If you're not sure, get in touch and we'll help.

Check Loganair flight times and book at loganair.co.uk — Glasgow to Islay (GLA–ILY). Fares vary significantly; book early for the best prices.

=== BLOCK: Food & Drink on Islay ===
Islay's food scene emphasises local seafood, lamb, venison and whisky. Dining out generally isn't cheap, but quality is high. Most guests cook meals in our well-equipped kitchens as well and eat out selectively. Here's where we recommend:

Our Top Recommendations

Lochindaal Seafood Kitchen, Port Charlotte

Lochindaal Seafood Kitchen is truly exceptional, run with huge heart by Jack and his father Iain — seafood platters from the local fishermen's catch, featuring local oysters, langoustines, crab, and mussels among others. You do need to order the full platter 24 hours ahead, but it's really worth planning around. Small, cosy venue in Port Charlotte with two bars. Book ahead — it fills fast. Our guests consistently rave about this place. Also a great whisky selection if you just want to drop in for a pint or a dram.

Port Charlotte Hotel

Scottish fare and an outstanding whisky bar with 300+ bottles on their single malt menu. The restaurant takes bookings (advised), but the bar is walk-in. Good Sunday roasts. Traditional Scottish live music on Wednesdays and Sundays is popular and a lovely way to spend an evening by a roaring log fire, dram in hand. We send guests here regularly, and they're never disappointed.

[An Tigh Seinnse, Portnahaven](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ec4m6CxY1YW1DJJ28)

An Tigh Seinnse — Traditional little village pub at the end of the Rhinns, with home-cooked food and local charm in possibly Islay's most remote coastal village. Small, authentic, popular with locals and visitors. Book ahead — it's worth the 20-minute drive from Bruichladdich. You can nearly always spot seals in Portnahaven harbour, just outside the pub.

Food and Drink in Bowmore

Peatzeria, Bowmore — Creative wood-fired pizzas with Islay twists — toppings include local lobster, scallops, and whisky-infused sauces. Casual, family-friendly, good for a relaxed dinner.

The Cottage, Bowmore — Burgers, fries, jacket potatoes, and good comfort grub.

Islay's Plaice, Bowmore — Fresh fish and chips cooked perfectly by Andy and Islay!

Bowmore town centre — Chinese and Indian takeaways, bakery, butcher. Useful for stocking up or grabbing quick meals when you don't want to cook or book ahead.

Food and Drink in Port Ellen

The Copper Still, Port Ellen — Amazing home-roasted coffee, handmade deli sandwiches, cakes, soup and the best brownies on the planet; run with love by Mari and Joe; by the ferry terminal.

SeaSalt Bistro, Port Ellen — Pizza, pasta, seafood and steaks on the Port Ellen waterfront.

Distillery Cafés

Ardbeg — great café, excellent lunch stop on any south coast distillery day

Ardnahoe — visitor centre with food & drinks, great views across the Sound of Islay

Kilchoman — café at the farm distillery, excellent for lunch

Groceries & Self-Catering

Aileen's Mini-Market, Bruichladdich (5-minute walk from our properties) Coffee, bacon rolls, newspapers, basic groceries, post office. We love Aileen and our guests absolutely rave about this place — start your morning here with a coffee and bacon roll, particularly after a heavy day of distillery tours! Aileen's (known locally as Debbie's!) is a Bruichladdich institution.

Co-op, Bowmore (15-minute drive) The biggest "supermarket" on Islay — small but sufficient, with fresh produce, meat, alcohol, household supplies. This is your main grocery stop for stocking the kitchen.

Co-op, Port Ellen (45-minute drive) Another smaller Co-op supermarket on the seafront at Port Ellen stocking essentials.

Port Charlotte Stores (5-minute drive from our properties) All-round basic shop, post office and petrol pump for essentials.

Jean's Fresh Fish Van

Visits villages weekly — check local schedules. Fresh local fish and seafood delivered to your door essentially.

Dining In

Most guests tend to cook several meals during their stay. Our kitchens are fully equipped with everything you need if that's your preference. Dining out every night adds up quickly on Islay — expect £40-60 per person for dinner with drinks.

=== BLOCK: Islay Archaeology Overview ===
Islay has been continuously inhabited for more than 8,000 years. Its surviving heritage spans from Precambrian geology through Bronze Age cairns, Iron Age duns, the finest Early Christian carved cross in Scotland, the medieval seat of a Gaelic dynasty that rivalled the Scottish crown, contested coastal castles, and two World War One memorials that mark one of the war's strangest maritime disasters. Most of these sites are free, open year-round, and remarkably unvisited. The concentration of significant history within 50 minutes' drive of our Bruichladdich properties is, by any measure, unusual.

The Oldest Layer: Bunnahabhain Stromatolites

The oldest thing on Islay is also the most improbable. The rock outcrops near Bunnahabhain Distillery on the north coast contain fossilised stromatolites — layered structures formed by microbial mats in ancient shallow seas — dating to approximately 1.2 billion years ago. They are among the oldest macroscopic fossils in Britain, preserved in Dalradian quartzite on a working coastline. Park at Bunnahabhain Distillery, walk through the distillery yard to the southern end past the cottages, and take the gate onto the rough coastal path toward Rubha a'Mhill; the first fossilised exposures appear approximately 50 metres after the gate, in boulders of Bonahaven Dolomite along the shore. Best viewed at low tide. Combine with a visit to Bunnahabhain, Caol Ila, or Ardnahoe for a north coast day that covers 1.2 billion years and a dram in the same afternoon.

Standing Stones, Cairns, and Hillforts: Islay's Prehistoric Landscape

Before the Lordship, the Lords, and the Early Christian missionaries came something older still. Rubha Port an t-Seilich on Islay's east coast is one of the best-preserved Mesolithic sites in Britain — 12,000-year-old flint tools from the period immediately following the last Ice Age, still visible in the soil for the researchers and archaeologists who return here regularly. Bolsay Farm on the Rhinns adds another chapter: a Mesolithic hunting camp from which over 300,000 flint artefacts have been recovered, now largely held at the Museum of Islay Life in Port Charlotte.

The Bronze Age monuments are harder to miss. The Ballinaby Standing Stones on the northern Rhinns include one stone over four metres tall — difficult to overlook against the Islay skyline. Cultoon Stone Circle near Portnahaven is uniquely strange: fifteen massive stones were laid out in a circle but only two or three were ever raised upright. The project was abandoned mid-construction, leaving a monument to an intention that was never completed. It is one of the more thought-provoking sites on the island. At Dun Nosebridge, an Iron Age hillfort near Mulindry between Bridgend and Ballygrant, the scale of the island's pre-medieval occupation becomes clear. The fort covers 375 square metres and commands 360-degree views of Islay's interior — a short walk from the road, ten minutes from Bowmore. None of these sites charge admission or require booking.

The Lordship of the Isles: Finlaggan

Finlaggan, on the shores of Loch Finlaggan in central Islay, is where the Lordship of the Isles administered its domain from approximately 1150 to 1493. The Lordship was the most powerful Gaelic polity in medieval Scotland — a maritime empire that at its height controlled the Hebrides, much of the western mainland, and the Isle of Man, operating under Gaelic law and a political structure independent of and often in conflict with the Scottish crown. The Lords of the Isles met on Eilean na Comhairle (Council Island), the smaller of Finlaggan's two islands; Eilean Mòr (the great island) held the great hall, chapel, and residence buildings. The Lordship was forfeited to the Scottish crown in 1493 and never re-established. Finlaggan was abandoned and has stood largely undisturbed since. The visitor centre is open from Saturday 5 April, Monday to Saturday 1100–1630, closed Sunday; entry is by donation. The islands are accessible year-round via a short path and causeway. It is 25 minutes' drive from our properties.

The Kildalton Cross: 8th Century, Still Standing

The Kildalton Cross stands in the graveyard of Kildalton Church on the south-east coast of Islay and has stood there since it was carved, approximately 800 AD. It is a ringed high cross carved from a single block of blue-grey epidiorite, 2.65 metres high, and it is — by the consensus of scholars and the assessment of Historic Environment Scotland — the finest surviving example of early Christian carved stonework in Scotland, and one of the finest in Europe. The carving includes Old Testament scenes, a Virgin and Child in the central roundel, and interlaced knotwork of exceptional quality. The condition of the carving after 1,200 years in the open Scottish air is remarkable. There is no admission fee, no enclosure, and rarely a crowd. The site is 50 minutes' drive from our properties; the most scenic approach is the Kildalton Shoreline Walk from Port Ellen, which passes Laphroaig, Lagavulin, and Ardbeg on the way.

Clan Battles and Contested Castles: Kilnave and Dunyvaig

Kilnave Chapel, on the shore of Loch Gruinart, was built in the late 14th or early 15th century and was the site of one of the darkest episodes in Islay's clan history. On 5 August 1598, the Battle of Traigh Gruinart — the last major clan battle on Islay — was fought on the flats below, between the MacDonalds of Islay and the MacLeans of Mull. Thirty MacLean survivors retreated to the chapel; the MacDonalds fired the thatched roof. All died except one man — a Mac Mhuirich — who escaped through a hole in the burning thatch as it collapsed. The ruins remain open to the sky. Standing immediately to the west is a carved stone cross that predates the chapel by roughly 600 years — an unringed 8th-century cross, 3.35 metres tall, comparable in age to the Kildalton Cross but ringless and far more weathered. Dunyvaig Castle, on the south coast near Lagavulin, was a major MacDonald stronghold from the 12th to the 17th century — the naval base of the Lords of the Isles and later the scene of repeated sieges as control of the island passed between MacDonalds, MacLeans, and ultimately the crown. The castle is ruinous and accessible from the Kildalton Shoreline Walk path; do not enter the structure.

The Round Church and the Cleared Townships

Kilarrow Parish Church in Bowmore — locally called the Round Church — was built in 1767, the only circular church on Islay. The tradition that it was built round to deny the Devil a corner to hide in is almost certainly apocryphal, but the building is genuinely distinctive and still in use as a parish church. Islay's landscape also carries the more painful evidence of its 18th and 19th century history. The island's population fell from approximately 15,000 to 6,000 in the first half of the 19th century through clearances, famine, and emigration. The cleared and abandoned townships are visible across the island, particularly on the Oa peninsula: Tockmal near Soldier's Rock, Grasdale, Frachdale, Lurabus, and Lower Killeyan are among the named settlements the RSPB The Oa reserve now covers. Near Ardbeg, the hills hold Solam — the plague village — abandoned after a local tradition holds that an 18th-century epidemic followed a shipwrecked sailor's gift; a plaque on site recounts the story. Near Keills, Kilslevan preserves the outline of eight longhouses and a chapel. The Museum of Islay Life in Port Charlotte holds census records and estate papers documenting the island's depopulated areas.

The World War One Chapter: The Oa and Kilchoman

On 5 February 1918, the troopship USS Tuscania was torpedoed by a German submarine off the Oa peninsula — the first American troopship sunk in the war — with the loss of around 200 US soldiers. On 6 October 1918, the HMT Otranto collided with another vessel in a storm off the same coast and sank with the loss of over 400, including hundreds of American troops bound for France. Their bodies came ashore on Islay's beaches. The American Monument on the clifftop of the Oa was erected by the American Red Cross in 1920 and is maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Kilchoman Military Cemetery, 20 minutes' drive from our properties near Kilchoman Church and Kilchoman Distillery, contains the graves of British and American servicemen recovered from both disasters. The two sites together tell the same story from two vantage points: the clifftop monument where the ships went down, and the quiet churchyard where the men were buried.

=== BLOCK: Islay Villages Overview ===
Islay has six villages of genuinely distinct character, all within 45 minutes' drive of each other. Our three properties — Portbahn House, Shorefield Eco House, and Curlew Cottage — sit on the Loch Indaal shoreline near Bruichladdich, which puts Port Charlotte, Bowmore, and Portnahaven within easy reach on a single morning. The rest of the island opens from there: Port Askaig on the north coast for the Jura ferry, Port Ellen in the south as the gateway to the whisky coast.

Port Charlotte

Port Charlotte is the village we recommend first to guests and the one most come back to. It was built as a planned village in the early 19th century — a neat grid of whitewashed houses running down to the Loch Indaal shore — and the planning shows: it has a shape and a purpose that most Hebridean villages lack. The Museum of Islay Life is here, one of the better small local museums in Scotland and well worth an hour. The Port Charlotte Hotel has a log fire, over 300 single malts, and live music on Wednesday and Sunday evenings. Lochindaal Seafood Kitchen — our top restaurant on the island — is on the waterfront. Port Charlotte is a 5-minute drive from our properties, or 40 minutes on foot along the coastal cycle path that passes our front door.

Bowmore

Bowmore is Islay's main town, set at the head of Loch Indaal where the island's main roads converge. It is functional rather than picturesque — but it is honest, well-stocked, and important to know. The Co-op is the only proper supermarket on the island; the pharmacy and bank are here; Islay's Plaice does reliable fish and chips; Peatzeria does wood-fired pizza in an old church. Bowmore Distillery sits at the foot of the main street, claimed as Islay's oldest at 1779. At the top of the street, Kilarrow Parish Church (the Round Church, 1767) is one of only a handful of round churches in Scotland — a five-minute stop that repays the curiosity. The Mactaggart Leisure Centre has an indoor swimming pool, useful for families on wet days. Bowmore is 15 minutes' drive from our Bruichladdich properties.

Portnahaven and Port Wemyss

Portnahaven and Port Wemyss are two connected villages at the southern tip of the Rhinns peninsula — a 20-minute drive from our properties along a single-track road that gets quieter and emptier the further south you travel. The harbour at Portnahaven almost always has common seals hauled out on the rocks, often within a few feet of the wall. An Tigh Seinnse is a small, genuinely local pub with home-cooked food and perhaps 20 seats — the best lunch on the Rhinns outside Port Charlotte. Open year-round; winter hours apply from November. Reservations are required (01496 860725); regular season hours: Thursday to Sunday from noon, Wednesday from 4:30pm, closed Monday and Tuesday. Confirm hours for winter visits. The sense of being at the very end of the road is real. Both villages together are smaller than a single Bowmore street.

Port Ellen

Port Ellen on the south coast is where the CalMac ferry from Kennacraig arrives for the longer crossing (2 hours 20 minutes), and it marks the start of Islay's most celebrated distillery cluster. Laphroaig, Lagavulin, and Ardbeg are all within a 10-minute drive east along the coast road, and Port Ellen Distillery — one of whisky's most storied lost distilleries — reopened in 2024 after four decades closed. The Copper Still café by the ferry terminal is our favourite café on the island. SeaSalt Bistro on the waterfront is a good dinner option for south coast evenings. Port Ellen is 45 minutes from our Bruichladdich properties — a south coast day from there is one of the best on the island.

Bridgend and Port Askaig

Bridgend sits at the head of Loch Indaal where the main island roads meet — not a destination village but a useful crossroads. The petrol pump at Bridgend Village Stores is one of the island's most important landmarks when your tank is running low. The Lochside Hotel has a bar and food. Port Askaig on the north coast is the other ferry terminal — faster crossing from Kennacraig (2 hours), closer to the north coast distilleries, and the departure point for the 5-minute Jura ferry. The Port Askaig Hotel bar is worth knowing; there is little else at Port Askaig. Both are practical stops on an island where practicality is part of the plan.

=== BLOCK: Islay with Children ===
Islay is a wonderful holiday for families. Like winding the clock back fifty years if you want to. Safe beaches for rock pooling, wildlife on your doorstep, playgrounds in most of the villages, and just enough activities to fill the days without overscheduling. Children thrive here because they have space to roam, explore, and get properly muddy. And happy children equals happy families!

We've hosted dozens of families in our houses over the years, and we've raised our two children here on both islands — so we know what a special place this is for kids. We know the beaches they love, the rainy day escapes, and the wildlife moments that stick with them. These are the things we do with our own children, rain or sun.

Safe Beaches for Kids

Portbahn Beach is our hidden gem — a 5-minute walk from our properties via the war memorial path. Three sheltered bays with rock pools at low tide, safe for paddling, and you'll usually have it entirely to yourselves. Our kids have spent countless hours here collecting shells, watching crabs, and building dams in the rock pools. It's our go-to spot.

Port Charlotte Beach is a 5-minute drive — shallow, sandy, with easy parking and the village right there for ice cream after.

On the southeast coast, Laggan Bay and Kilnaughton Bay (near Port Ellen) offer miles of shallow, sandy shoreline perfect for building sandcastles and safe wading.

Sanaigmore is a dramatic stretch of northern coast with great rock formations for playing hide and seek — our two love it here. There's also a lovely small art gallery nearby serving coffee and cakes for the grown-ups!

Ardnave Point is another favourite — rolling dunes perfect for kids running full pelt, with big skies and empty beaches. Combine it with a roam through the nature trail and woods at nearby RSPB Loch Gruinart for a proper adventure day.

IMPORTANT: The big Atlantic beaches (Machir Bay, Saligo Bay) are stunning for walks but not safe for swimming — strong currents and undertows. We take our children there for dramatic coastal walks, but stick to the sheltered and shallow Loch Indaal beaches for actual paddling.

Rainy Day Activities

When the weather turns (and it will, hourly! — this is Scotland!), we'll often head for the Mactaggart Leisure Centre in Bowmore. The indoor swimming pool is a great place to hang out on wet days and has saved many a holiday. Check their Facebook page — they often have giant inflatables in the school holidays.

Persabus Pottery is run with love by the wonderful Rosemary, and it's another of our family favourites — for kids and grown-ups alike. Our house has plenty of treasured mugs and bowls painted by our children over the years, as do their grandparents' homes! It's a creative activity that keeps everyone engaged for a couple of hours while the rain lashes down outside.

Older children find the Islay Woollen Mill interesting, with its working looms and the story of island tweed. They produce tweeds for some of the top design houses in the world — do ask them about it!

Honestly, some of our best family days have been wet ones — board games by the fire, hot chocolate, and watching the weather roll across Loch Indaal from the window. Island kids learn to embrace it. There's no such thing as bad weather!

Wildlife Adventures

This is where Islay really makes memories for families. Rock pooling at Portbahn Beach at low tide reveals crabs, sea anemones, whelks and tiny fish — our kids always got excited about this while we were living at Portbahn House. Walk the coastal paths and you'll spot seals bobbing in the water — Portnahaven harbour is almost guaranteed. Between October and April, the barnacle geese at Loch Gruinart are unforgettable — 30,000+ birds lifting off at dawn, honking. We take our children every autumn and it never gets old. Eagles circle overhead year-round if you keep looking up.

Family-Friendly Eating

The distillery cafés are surprisingly family-friendly — Ardbeg has excellent food and welcomes children, as do Kilchoman and Ardnahoe. Peatzeria in Bowmore does creative wood-fired pizzas in a casual setting that works well with kids — who doesn't love a pizza?! In Bowmore you'll also find The Cottage for burgers, fries, jacket potatoes, and Islay's Plaice for fresh fish and chips that kids and adults alike will devour.

And if you just want to stay in and cook your old home favourites, all our houses have well-equipped kitchens — it's more relaxed, cheaper, and kids eat what they actually want. Hopefully!

Our Properties for Families

Portbahn House has a sunken trampoline and swings in a secure garden — kids can play while you watch from the kitchen. It sleeps 8, so there's space for everyone.

Curlew Cottage is set back from the road surrounded by farmland and has a fully enclosed walled patio garden — ideal for younger children who want to run around safely. Cosy inside, peaceful outside.

Shorefield Eco House appeals to older children who'll appreciate the bird hides and wildlife watching from the windows — grab the binoculars and see what you can spot. Even if bird watching isn't their thing, kids can get lost in the woods behind the house, playing hide and seek or making dens and creating adventures.

One guest told us, "The kids didn't want screens all week — they were too busy with the beach, the trampoline, and counting seals." That's exactly the kind of holiday Islay offers — and it's the childhood our own kids have had here.

=== BLOCK: Islay's Ten Whisky Distilleries ===
Having lived and worked on Islay for a number of years, we know the island well and want to share our take on the whisky scene. Islay currently has ten working whisky distilleries, and you're just a 5-minute walk from one of the world's best and certainly most innovative — and the reason we came to the islands — Bruichladdich.

Islay produces some of the world's most celebrated single malts and people come here from all over the world, almost as a pilgrimage, particularly for the intensely peated, smoky whiskies that are synonymous with Islay's maritime character. Many visitors plan entire trips around distillery tours and tastings — we've hosted whisky groups dozens of times, and we're always happy to help you plan your distillery days.

The Ten Islay Distilleries

Ardbeg — Intensely peated, cult following, stunning coastal location, wonderful café

Lagavulin — Classic Islay style, 16-year flagship, accessible from Port Ellen

Laphroaig — Medicinal, iodine notes, right on the shore — love it or hate it!

Bowmore — Claims to be Islay's oldest (1779), balanced peat, town centre location

Bruichladdich — Innovative and radical; world's most heavily peated as well as unpeated expressions + The Botanist gin, 5-minute walk from our properties

Kilchoman — Farm distillery, barley to bottle on-site, very visitor-friendly, great café for lunch

Bunnahabhain — Gentle, mostly unpeated, remote northern location with stunning views of the Paps of Jura

Caol Ila — Largest Islay producer, used in Johnnie Walker, Port Askaig, dramatic setting

Ardnahoe — Opened 2018, Port Askaig, lightly-peated, core expressions now available, great café with views across the Sound of Islay

Port Ellen — Closed 1983, fully reopened 2024, south coast, heavily-peated, by appointment only via malts.com

Our Recommendation: Start at Bruichladdich

Tour Bruichladdich first — it's our nearest distillery, an easy 5-minute walk along the coastal path and it really is genuinely unique.

Self-styled Progressive Hebridean Distillers, Bruichladdich are one of the most creative whisky distillers in Scotland, driving the importance of terroir and provenance throughout all their single malts. They release very limited editions of single farm, single vintage and single barley varieties each year in their Islay Barley and Bere Barley ranges. They're also quite special in that their malts range from the unpeated Laddie Classic, through the more traditionally Islay heavily-peated Port Charlotte, to the world's peatiest whisky, the highly exclusive Octomore range.

For gin lovers, the distillery is also home to the world-class, award-winning Botanist Gin. There's genuinely something for everybody at Bruichladdich, which is why it makes such a good first visit.

The distillery tours and whisky tastings, particularly the warehouse experience, are truly excellent — personal and a fascinating insight into the pedigree of whisky in quite a different way.

As a bonus, you can walk home afterward without worrying about driving. We recommend this to every guest, and the feedback is always very positive. It really is the one place we'd urge you to go if you're only visiting one distillery.

From there, plan your distillery days based on your whisky preferences. Heavily peated? Focus on the short stretch of southern coast that contains Ardbeg, Lagavulin, and Laphroaig (the south coast "killers"). A bit softer with more balance? Bowmore. Small and traditional? Head for Kilchoman and have lunch at the café. For something gentler, Bunnahabhain produces beautiful unpeated malts. And if you want to see whisky production at scale and with technology, head for Caol Ila or Ardnahoe.

How Many Distilleries Per Day?

Two per day is comfortable. Three can become rushed and overwhelming. It also depends where you're heading.

It makes sense to visit Ardbeg, Laphroaig and Lagavulin as a trio since they're so close — a natural south coast cluster. Port Ellen is also on this stretch and is now open for pre-booked tours (appointment only via malts.com). Ardbeg has a great café so you can break the day with lunch there.

On the north coast, Caol Ila, Bunnahabhain and Ardnahoe sit along the Sound of Islay facing the Paps of Jura and make another good cluster, with good food and drinks at the Ardnahoe visitor centre.

Something to remember: factor in travel time between distilleries (some are 45+ minutes apart), and remember that tastings accumulate quickly. Pace yourself and actually enjoy the experience rather than ticking boxes.

Our whisky groups typically tour 5-6 distilleries over 3-4 full days, with beach walks and meals in between. That rhythm seems to work really well. See our food and drink guide for the best distillery café lunch stops.

And make sure you leave time for Islay's other attractions — most importantly, the pace of life!

Booking Distillery Tours

Book tours in advance — essential for summer dates and absolutely critical for Fèis Ìle (the whisky festival in late May). Most distilleries limit tour sizes and fill up weeks ahead. Tours typically run 10am-4pm with limited afternoon slots. Check individual distillery websites for availability and prices.

Most distilleries offer standard tours (45-60 minutes, £10-15) plus premium experiences with warehouse tastings or rare drams (£40-80+). If you're serious about whisky, the premium tours are worth it.

Drinking and Driving

Scotland's drink-drive limit is effectively zero — take this seriously. Distilleries provide "driver's drams" — takeaway miniatures for designated drivers to enjoy later at your accommodation. This system works well. Let them know who's driving when you arrive for a tasting and they'll usually help you out.

Alternatively, hire a guide or taxi for distillery days. We can recommend local drivers who specialise in distillery tours if you'd prefer not to worry about limits.

=== BLOCK: Jura Day Trip ===
A short 5-minute ferry from Port Askaig connects Islay to the neighbouring Isle of Jura, although it genuinely feels like a world away. Alongside its whisky, the island is perhaps most notable as the place Orwell wrote 1984 and the K Foundation burned a million pounds. While Islay has a gentle borders/lowland feel, Jura is all Highland. It makes a perfect day trip to see the dramatic Paps of Jura mountains, visit Jura Distillery, have lunch at the Antlers or Jura Hotel, hire bikes and walk or cycle around Small Isles Bay to Corran Sands. Or for a real treat, drive up to Ardlussa, sample some Lussa Gin and admire the stunning coastal scenery.

Getting There

The small car ferry runs roughly every hour from Port Askaig. No booking needed for foot passengers — just turn up at least 10 minutes before scheduled departure. Short queue for cars, but check the timetable for last ferry times and travel alerts — the weather and tides affect sailings. For getting to Islay itself, see the travel to Islay guide.

A Perfect Day Trip

Morning ferry from Port Askaig (5 minutes)

Jura Distillery tour — Book ahead for tours, or drop in for a dram

Lunch at the Antlers (homebaked deli food, friendly atmosphere) or Jura Hotel (restaurant dining and pub grub)

Afternoon — Hire bikes and cycle to Small Isles Bay / Corran Sands, or walk the coastal path; pop into the church and photographs of old Jura life round the back

Wildlife — Red deer everywhere, often on the roadside; eagles and sea otters are frequently seen

Views — The Paps of Jura dominate every vista

Return ferry — Check timetable for last sailing. Book the late 2130 ferry 24 hours in advance if you really want a full day and evening meal.

Or, drive straight to Ardlussa in the north, visit the wonderful girls at award-winning locally made Lussa Gin and slowly meander back, taking in Jura's dramatic coastline and bays.

=== BLOCK: Jura Longer Stay ===
For those wanting to explore Jura properly (and we really do recommend it!), a longer stay gives you so much more, with experiences you simply can't fit into a day:

Barnhill & George Orwell

At the remote northern tip of Jura, Barnhill is where George Orwell wrote 1984 in 1946-48. The house still stands (a private house still owned by the Fletcher family — please do respect their privacy), and the journey to reach it — 25 miles of single-track road, the last 4 miles a rough track that must be walked — is an adventure in itself. For literary pilgrims it's a great excuse to head north.

Corryvreckan Whirlpool

The third largest whirlpool in the world churns between Jura and Scarba. Visible from the northern tip of Jura, it's most dramatic at certain tides. Orwell nearly drowned here in 1947 — nearly losing the manuscript of 1984 in the process. Boat trips from Robert at Jura Boat Tours will take you right up close and are a dramatic way to experience the island and regularly spot eagles and dolphins.

Climb a Pap

The three Paps of Jura (Beinn an Oir is the highest at 785m) are serious hill walks — not technical climbing, but hard going with no paths and often a scramble over bog and rock. They are steep and remote. But a clear day rewards you with views to Ireland, Mull, and the mainland. Not for novices, but achievable for fit hikers. Leave a full day and let someone know the route you are taking.

Jura's West Coast

Jura's Atlantic west coast is one of Britain's wildest landscapes — raised beaches, caves, no roads, no people. Walking it requires planning and fitness, but it's genuinely remote in a way few places in Britain can match. It takes about a week to do tip to tip. If you want a taste of the west coast, it can be accessed at Tarbert in the middle of Jura, down a track leading from the main road to the head of Loch Tarbert, the huge bite out of Jura's west coast. There is also a track that heads north from Feolin past Inver Estate lodge that gives easy access to the west coast in about an hour or so's walking.

K Foundation Burn A Million Pounds

For pop culture pilgrims: the boathouse where the KLF's Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty burned £1 million in 1994 is on Jura's Ardfin Estate, now a private golf course (the irony!). Scotland's Right to Roam laws do allow access, but be sensitive.

Wildlife

Red deer are everywhere — you'll see dozens daily. Eagles soar over the Paps. Seals and otters inhabit the coastline and are regularly seen around Small Isles Bay.

The Pace

Even slower than Islay. One shop, one hotel, one pub, two distilleries. If you want true escape, this is it.

Consider combining a few days on Jura with your Islay stay — we have accommodation with hot tubs and saunas at Bothan Jura Retreat and can help you plan a multi-island trip.

=== BLOCK: Loch Gruinart Oysters ===
Loch Gruinart is one of Islay's most remarkable places — a tidal loch on the northern Rhinns that functions simultaneously as an RSPB nature reserve for migratory barnacle geese and the source of some of the finest oysters in the UK. The Oyster Shed, Islay sits at the loch's edge and sells freshly shucked oysters direct to visitors, with a small restaurant serving lunch Thursday to Saturday.

The cold, clean, nutrient-rich tidal waters of Loch Gruinart give the oysters a distinctly briny, clean flavour. Atlantic water, filtered through Islay's peat landscape and driven by strong tidal flow, creates near-ideal growing conditions. We'd back Loch Gruinart oysters against any in Britain — Whitstable included. The Times agreed.

The Oyster Shed opens Thursday, Friday and Saturday, 10am–3pm. Lunch is served 11:30am–2:30pm (last orders). Table booking is advisable — call 07376 781214 for all enquiries and reservations.

Loch Gruinart is 20 minutes' drive from our properties in Bruichladdich. The combination of the RSPB reserve and the Oyster Shed makes it one of the best half-days on the island. In winter, arrive at dawn to watch 30,000+ barnacle geese lift from the loch. Come back Thursday to Saturday for oysters at the shed. If you time it right, you can do both on the same day.

Contact: 07376 781214 — call to book and to check opening before travelling. @oystershed_islay on Instagram for current updates.

=== BLOCK: Planning Your Trip to Islay ===
Do You Need a Car on Islay?

Yes, a car is strongly recommended. Islay has limited public transport, and taxis must be booked in advance. Most distilleries, beaches, and attractions require driving to reach. The freedom to explore at your own pace is essential to enjoying the island.

Car Hire

Islay Car Hire operates from the airport and ferry ports

Book well in advance, especially for summer and Fèis Ìle dates

Expect small, practical vehicles — no luxury fleet, but perfectly adequate

Daily rates are reasonable; weekly rates offer better value

Driving on Islay

The main roads allow traffic in both directions, but some parts of the island have single-track roads with passing places. Locals use passing places to allow faster traffic to overtake, not just for oncoming vehicles. Driving is relaxed and unhurried — expect wildlife on roads (sheep, cattle, birds).

You'll also notice oncoming drivers waving at you — or more commonly lifting a finger off the wheel. This is the famous Islay wave, a simple bit of courtesy acknowledging other drivers. Reciprocate if you feel like it. It's part of island culture.

Distances from Bruichladdich

Bruichladdich Distillery: 5-minute walk

Port Charlotte (restaurants, shops): 5-minute drive / 40-minute walk

Port Ellen ferry terminal: 35 minutes drive

Port Askaig ferry terminal: 25 minutes drive

Machir Bay beach: 15 minutes drive

Ardbeg / Lagavulin / Laphroaig distilleries: 40–50 minutes drive

How Many Days?

Minimum: 2–3 nights allows time to visit 3–4 distilleries and see main beaches

Recommended: 5–7 nights for leisurely exploration, Jura day trip, wildlife watching

Whisky-focused: 3–4 full days to visit 5–6 distilleries comfortably

Remember your first and last days are mostly travel — a week-long stay gives you 5 genuine activity days. Our guests who book for 7+ nights consistently tell us they wished they'd had longer. Also consider including a couple of days on Jura, a dramatically different island, to really experience this part of the Hebrides.

Best Time to Visit

April–June: Sunniest months, good weather, fewer crowds, reasonable prices

July–August: Warmest (relatively), busiest, school holiday premium

Late May: Fèis Ìle whisky festival — book accommodation and ferry 12+ weeks ahead

September–October: Barnacle geese arrive (30,000+ birds), beautiful autumn light

Winter (November–March): Dramatic weather, limited daylight, some distilleries closed

What to Pack

Waterproof jacket and layers (weather changes rapidly)

Walking boots or sturdy shoes for coastal paths and beaches

Binoculars for wildlife (optional but recommended)

Sunglasses and sunscreen (surprising amounts of sun between showers)

Your own beach towels or dog towels if bringing pets (we provide bath towels only)

=== BLOCK: Port Charlotte Village ===
Port Charlotte is perhaps Islay's prettiest village, just a 5-minute drive or 40-minute walk along the coastal path from our properties. It's the social hub of the Rhinns, with regular live music at the Port Charlotte Hotel and immense local seafood platters at the Lochindaal — it has everything you'll need for a self-catering break.

Where to Eat & Drink

Port Charlotte Hotel — Owned and run by Grahame and Isabelle, with Scottish fare and an outstanding whisky bar with 300+ bottles on their single malt menu. The restaurant takes bookings (advised), but the bar is walk-in. Good Sunday roasts. Traditional Scottish live music on Wednesdays and Sundays is popular and a lovely way to spend an evening by a roaring log fire, dram in hand.

Lochindaal Seafood Kitchen — Truly exceptional, run with huge heart by Jack and his father Iain. An absolute highlight (we'd say a MUST), the seafood platters from the local fishermen's catch feature oysters, langoustines, crab, lobster and mussels. You need to order the full platter 24 hours ahead and it may vary depending on catch — but it is absolutely worth planning around. Also a great whisky selection if you just want to drop in for a pint or a dram. Our guests consistently rave about this place and it's one of our favourite spots on the Rhinns. See the full food & drink guide →

What Else You'll Find

The Museum of Islay Life tells the history of the island. There's a local shop, post office and petrol station for essentials. For families, the children's playground at Port Mor has sea views and is a favourite with our kids and our guests' children. There's also a good café serving great comfort food.

=== BLOCK: Portbahn Beach ===
Portbahn Beach is our hidden gem — literally 5 minutes from our door via the war memorial path. It's three small, sheltered bays tucked into the coastline with stunning views across Loch Indaal. Safe for swimming, perfect for rock pooling with kids, and you'll almost always have it entirely to yourselves.

There's rarely any tidal flow in Loch Indaal, making it very safe, but still plenty of rock pools and places to go crabbing. The water around Islay is cold (10-14°C typical), but it's sheltered enough for a quick dip if you're brave. One guest wrote: "Better than the pictures — we had breakfast on Portbahn Beach every morning and saw seals."

This is genuinely one of Islay's best kept secrets, and it's our local spot — so pretty much yours to explore at will from the moment you arrive! For all our recommended beaches on Islay, see the beaches guide.

=== BLOCK: Shorefield Character ===
Shorefield is the Jackson family's old family home — their personality is everywhere, and we're privileged to look after it for them. They built this eco-house to include wind and solar power well before it was popular, planted every tree on the property, created the wetlands and bird hides, and filled the house over the years with paintings, books, and curios from their travels around the world.

It's quirky, full of personality, well worn and well loved over years of family use. This isn't a styled rental; it's a real family home. If you prefer bright, modern open-plan simplicity, Portbahn House would probably suit you better. But if you value character, cosiness, and a house that feels like "a big hug" (as one guest said!), Shorefield really does make a wonderful stay. We love spending time here ourselves in the winter gardening and looking after the place.

The house is stocked with binoculars, bird books, and wildlife guides from the Jacksons' collection, along with their own sketches and watercolours. The garden, woods behind the house and wetland ponds attract plentiful birds, and the loch views offer opportunities to watch waterfowl and sea birds without leaving the property.

Over 90% of guests have told us they genuinely love the quirky charm and personal touches — it's what makes Shorefield special!

Woodlands, Wetlands and Bird Hides

Shorefield has something unique: woodlands, wetland ponds and bird hides created by the Jackson family, who were passionate birders. They planted the trees, created the wetlands, and built the hides specifically for wildlife watching. Even if bird watching isn't your thing, kids love getting lost in the woods behind the house, playing hide and seek, making dens and creating adventures.

If you're a birder or nature lover, Shorefield offers something you won't find at a typical holiday rental — it's a family home built around a love of wildlife and nature. See our wildlife guide for what to look out for on Islay.

Local knowledge & recommendations

We know Islay and Jura inside out and have lived on both islands with two children growing up. Our favourite beaches, distillery tours, restaurants, walks — we love to share all of it. You're not just renting a property; we hope you're getting a bit of our local expertise too. And if we don't know something, we can certainly tell you who does!

=== BLOCK: Walking on Islay ===
Islay rewards walkers at every level - from the flat coastal path that runs directly from our Bruichladdich properties to full-day circuits on the Oa peninsula and the exposed north coast. The island's walking is genuinely varied: shoreline paths, RSPB reserves, moorland, ancient island ruins, and Atlantic dune beaches you'll often have to yourselves. Most of the walks guests ask us about require no specialist equipment - sturdy footwear, layers, and waterproofs are the essentials on Islay whatever the weather.

What follows are the walks we actually recommend, roughly in order of how far you'll need to drive from our properties to reach them.

1. Bruichladdich Coastal Path to Port Charlotte

The coastal path to Port Charlotte starts outside the front door and runs 3 miles south along the Loch Indaal shoreline. The full walk takes 40 minutes each way, the path is tarmac and flat the whole way, and it is suitable for all abilities including pushchairs. From our properties, head south along the shared-use coastal cycle path past Bruichladdich Pier - a good spot for crabbing at low tide - and continue through the village past the war memorial and ferry slip. Port Charlotte comes into view after about 40 minutes, with the Museum of Islay Life, the Lochindaal Seafood Kitchen, and the Port Charlotte Hotel all a short walk from the path. Return the same way or take the B8018 road for variety. Portbahn Beach is a 5-minute detour off the coastal path via the war memorial path - a set of three sheltered coves that are one of Islay's quietest spots.

2. The Oa (RSPB Reserve)

The Oa peninsula forms Islay's dramatic south-western tip, about 35-40 minutes' drive from our properties - drive south through Bridgend and Port Ellen, then take the Oa road, following signs to the RSPB The Oa reserve car park at PA42 7AU. From the car park, the American Monument is a 20-minute walk along a well-marked path with boardwalk sections across the wetter ground. The full Mull of Oa circular route covers 2.2 miles and takes 1-1.5 hours - allow a full morning or afternoon including travel time. The American Monument is a memorial erected after World War One to the hundreds of US soldiers drowned when the troop ships Tuscania and Otranto were lost off the Oa in 1918 - it stands on the clifftop above the very spot where the Tuscania sank. On a clear day views extend to Ireland, the Kintyre Peninsula, and across Islay's south coast. Look out for choughs (red-billed crows - Islay has one of the UK's strongest populations), fulmars on the cliff ledges, and the chance of eagles hunting the moorland above the car park. The Oa is one of Islay's most exposed locations - conditions on the clifftops change quickly. Go well layered up with waterproofs even if the car park looks fine.

3. RSPB Loch Gruinart Reserve

RSPB Loch Gruinart is about 20 minutes' drive from our properties, heading north on the B8017. The reserve's visitor centre at Aoradh Farm has a car park, toilets, and hot drinks, and the Woodland Trail (1 mile/1.5km) runs from there to the viewing platform and hides overlooking the flooded fields and the tidal inlet of Loch Gruinart. The route to the viewing platform is suitable for most abilities, and visitors with mobility difficulties can call ahead to arrange closer vehicle access to the first hide. From October to April, the morning flights of barnacle and white-fronted geese are one of Islay's most extraordinary wildlife spectacles - as many as 24,000 geese have been counted on the reserve at once. Year-round, the hides give excellent views of waders, wildfowl, and raptors. For the full wildlife picture, see our wildlife guide.

4. Finlaggan (Loch Finlaggan)

Loch Finlaggan is about 25 minutes' drive from our properties - take the B8016 east from Bruichladdich towards Bridgend, then follow signs from the A846 at Ballygrant. The walk from the visitor centre car park to the island ruins is 15-20 minutes return across a flat path and causeway to Eilean Mòr in the loch, and is accessible for most abilities. The visitor centre (open April to October, Monday to Saturday, 11:00-16:30; the historic site is accessible 24/7) has an excellent introduction to the history. Finlaggan was the administrative and ceremonial seat of the Lordship of the Isles from the 12th to 16th centuries - the most powerful Gaelic dynasty in Scotland, controlling much of the Western Isles and western mainland from this island on Islay. The ruins are atmospheric and undervisited compared to Islay's south coast, and the loch setting is genuinely beautiful. Worth combining with the drive to Ardnahoe or Bunnahabhain distilleries for a full north Islay day.

5. Singing Sands (Tràigh Bhan)

Singing Sands - Tràigh Bhan in Gaelic - is a secluded beach near Port Ellen where the dry sand emits a quiet squeaking sound underfoot when disturbed, caused by the particular size and roundness of the grains. Access is from the Oa road south of Port Ellen: free parking by the cemetery at grid reference NR343455. From the car park, the path follows the coast around the headland to reach the beach - allow 45-60 minutes return. The beach is family-friendly and rarely crowded. The drive from our properties is approximately 30-35 minutes.

6. Machir Bay and Kilchoman

Machir Bay on Islay's Atlantic west coast is one of the island's most spectacular beaches - 2 miles of golden sand backed by dunes - and can be reached in about 20-25 minutes' drive from our properties via Bruichladdich and Kilchoman village. Park near Kilchoman Distillery at the end of the road. Kilchoman Distillery is immediately beside the car park and is Scotland's only barley-to-bottle farm distillery - the café does excellent lunches and the distillery is worth a visit in its own right. The beach walk south from the car park through the dunes to the bay and back is easy going and the scale of the beach is remarkable - on a clear day, it feels like the end of the world in the best possible sense. One essential safety point: Machir Bay and Saligo Bay to the north are not safe for swimming. Both beaches carry extremely strong rip currents at all states of tide. Walk them, photograph them, but do not enter the water. For swimming, our beaches guide covers the safe options - Portbahn Beach and Port Charlotte Beach are both within 5-40 minutes of our properties.

7. Ardnave Point

Ardnave Point on Islay's north coast is about 25-30 minutes' drive from our properties - head north on the B8017 towards Loch Gruinart, pass the RSPB visitor centre at Aoradh Farm, and continue 360 metres on the minor road north of the visitor centre to the grass car park at the south end of Ardnave Loch. The walk north along the Ardnave peninsula to the beach at the point is approximately 1.5km one way along a sandy track - relatively flat and straightforward. Ardnave Loch borders the track on the left as you head out and is worth scanning for ducks, waders, and the possible remains of an ancient crannog on the far shore. The peninsula narrows to a beach at Ardnave Point with big Atlantic views west to Colonsay and Oronsay. One of Islay's less-visited walking areas, Ardnave is excellent in winter for barnacle geese and choughs, and good for waders year-round. Combine with an early morning at RSPB Loch Gruinart for a full north Islay wildlife day.

Walking on Jura

Walking on Jura - the Paps of Jura, the Barnhill route, and Jura's wild Atlantic west coast - is a separate world. Jura is 5 minutes by ferry from Port Askaig, and our three Bruichladdich properties are about 30 minutes' drive from Port Askaig. See our Visit Jura guide for everything you need to plan a Jura walking day or longer stay. If you're considering climbing one of the Paps, plan for a full day and let someone know your route - they are serious hill walks, not a casual afternoon.
