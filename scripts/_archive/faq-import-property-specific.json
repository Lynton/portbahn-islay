    "question": "Can we check in early or have late checkout?",
    "answer": "Standard times are 4pm check-in and 10am checkout, but contact me about your ferry or flight times—I'm flexible when the property schedule allows. I can almost always accommodate bag drop-off before check-in or storage after checkout. Over 30 reviews specifically mention my flexibility and support, and I hold a 5.0/5 communication rating across all properties.",

    "question": "Which distillery should we visit first?",
    "answer": "Start with Bruichladdich—it's a 10-minute walk from Portbahn House (and our other properties) along the coastal path. You can tour the distillery, sample The Botanist gin, then walk home without worrying about driving.\n\nFrom there, choose based on your whisky preferences: heavily peated and smoky (Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroaig on the south coast), balanced peat (Bowmore, Kilchoman), or gentle/unpeated (Bunnahabhain in the north).\n\nBook tours at least 2-3 weeks in advance, especially for summer visits or Fèis Ìle (late May). Most distilleries offer standard tours (£10-15) and premium warehouse tastings (£40-80).",

    "answer": "Shorefield is the Jacksons' creation—they built this eco-house powered by wind and solar, planted every tree on the property, created the wetlands and bird hides, and filled the house with paintings, books, and curios from their travels around the world.\n\nIt's quirky, full of personality, and a bit tired in places—carpets need refreshing and furniture has been well-loved. This isn't a styled rental; it's a real family home. If you prefer modern perfection, Portbahn House is your match. But if you value character, coziness, and a house that feels like \"a big hug\" (as one guest said), Shorefield delivers.\n\nOver 90% of guests specifically love the quirky charm and personal touches—it's what makes Shorefield special.",

Most guests say it wasn't a problem and fits the property's vibe.\n\nIf a dishwasher is essential for your group, Portbahn House has one.

The house is stocked with binoculars, bird books, and wildlife guides from their personal collection.\n\nGrab the gear, head to your own private hide, and watch waterfowl and woodland birds. It's a genuinely unique feature that you won't find at typical holiday rentals—birders and nature lovers specifically book Shorefield for this.",

If you prefer modern finishes and pristine carpets, Portbahn House might suit you better. But if you value a house with a story and authentic charm, Shorefield is wonderful.
