**Reviewed:** 3 September 2025
**Score:** 9.0 - Perfect for relaxation with a fantastic view.

**Liked:** Shorefield is a great property for a group of friends. Plenty of room and different areas to relax and to enjoy the fabulous view. The location is perfect for exploring the island.

**Disliked:** It does need updating a little - carpets, rugs etc but this doesn't detract from the country charm. The showers are quite small.

> **Host Response:** Thank you for your lovely and honest review Sharon. Shorefield is a charming home, well loved and well lived. We are always making small adjustments to improve her looks without detracting from her charm, and appreciate you being sensitive with your comments! Sending our best wishes, Pi & The Team

**Stay Duration:** 2 nights - May 2025
**Trip Type:** Group
**Reviewed:** 29 May 2025
**Score:** 8.0 - Our family really enjoyed staying at this charming home near the coast!

**Liked:** Very charming, cozy home with an awesome location and views and within a short walking distance to the shore, Bruichladdich Distillery and the adorable local mini market.

**Disliked:** Nothing really-the furniture, rugs etc are a little worn down but that was already disclosed in the listing.

> **Host Response:** Thank you for your review, and fair description of Shorefield Jennifer; the house is a little charmer, though a little frayed here and there. We appreciate you made mention that this is disclosed. And a lovely mention for the mini market too! Very best to you all! Pi & The Team

### Esther

**Country:** United States
**Room Type:** Three-Bedroom House
**Stay Duration:** 3 nights - March 2025
**Trip Type:** Couple
**Reviewed:** 27 March 2025
**Score:** 9.0 - Superb

**Liked:** This place doesn't look like a carefully choreographed rental, it looks like a family home. And that's what it is. Beyond the stunning sea views, there's a story. Sit in the den with a book and a cup of tea in the evening. Or take your breakfast at the table in the kitchen near the sliding door and watch colorful little birds flit around the brush. It's tranquil and quiet, but would easily accommodate a family with kids as well.

**Disliked:** For those who are taller or have joint issues, the majority of the furniture here (outside of tables) is very low to the ground.

> **Host Response:** This is such a thoughtful review Esther; so grateful! We are all fond of Shorefield. My staying there is how I came to work with Pi & Lynton! Thank you for finding and rescuing the errant key! We truly hope you had a completely wonderful belated honeymoon, and send you both our very best!! Amba, Pi, et al.

**Liked:** No problems whatsoever

**Disliked:** The ferry schedule

> **Host Response:** First time I've been called an Inn Keeper Richard, and love that I'm amazing!! The weather did show up didn't it! Much safer tucked up and cosy, in our lovely toastie Shorefield, rather than bumping around on the sea in the storms!! The West Coast of Scotland can be a little bit petulant... Thank you again for choosing to stay with us. Very best wishes!

**Liked:** The view, spacious interior

**Disliked:** Lighting in toilets too low

> **Host Response:** Thanks for your glowing review Aiden, that's so kind! Apologies once again the electrician wasn't able to reach Shorefield to repair the bathroom light in time for your stay, and that the lamp we provided was a bit lacking in oomph!

**Score:** 9.0 - Definitely be booking this place if we were to visit this beautiful island again!

**Liked:** Easy to find, cosy, have good amenities and a working fire place. We enjoyed the living room.

**Disliked:** Not so far but only the bathroom light wasn't fixed on our arrival. But it is just a tiny issue. They have a second shower room downstairs though.

> **Host Response:** Oh my goodness we had some funny chats before you arrived Siu! So pleased you enjoyed your stay at Shorefield. The poor electricians on Islay are so stretched, and really do try to get to everyone as quick as they can, but Island life does require some patience, and 'out of the box' remedies. Thank you for being understanding x

### Tessa

**Country:** United States
**Room Type:** Three-Bedroom House
**Stay Duration:** 1 night - February 2024
**Trip Type:** Group
**Reviewed:** 23 February 2024
**Score:** 9.0 - Beautiful Bruichladdich home with everything you'll need

**Liked:** When we arrived, we were lucky enough to meet Pi, and she gave us excellent recommendations for the island (ate lunch at Ardbeg and it was incredible as she said it would be). She was so sweet and helpful. We loved the view! It's in a beautiful area, right on the ocean. We loved that there was plenty of space, and that the house was charming. Had everything we needed to cook meals. We were also happy to have Netflix to watch shows at night. And we were thrilled to have a washer and dryer so we could clean our clothes.

**Disliked:** There were only a few things we didn't like, but they're not big things. We loved our stay, the first night the house took a while to heat up so it was a bit chilly. Blankets in the living room would be nice, but we found a couple upstairs to use so it was fine. Also, the bath water got cold and couldn't fill the tub with warm water so we had to shower (which was surprisingly hot). We were very happy with our stay!

**Score:** 10 - Beautiful cottage

**Liked:** The cottage is in a great location with fantastic views over the Loch. The facilities on offer were fantastic with everything we required for our stay. From the directions to the property and on how to use the various equipment throughout meant we could relax and enjoy our short break. There was plenty of toys to keep our young granddaughter occupied and enough books and dvd's for the adults.

**Disliked:** Nothing, it was all good.

**Reviewed:** 17 June 2023
**Score:** 9.0 - Excellent start to our holiday in Scotland

**Liked:** Beachfront cottage which means we woke up to the sounds of waves and birdsong. Proximity to one of the distilleries we were visiting, and also near to a mini mart, while far from the madding crowd. Very specific instructions were given for use of amenities and the cottage was so comfortable we wished we had more time here!

**Disliked:** All good - initially the water heater didn't work but the host was quick to rectify the issue

### Donna

**Room Type:** Three-Bedroom House
**Stay Duration:** 1 night - September 2024
**Trip Type:** Couple
**Reviewed:** 6 September 2024
**Score:** 7.0 - It wasn't our cup of tea

**Liked:** The location was good

**Disliked:** Furniture very dated and a terrible smell when entering the property. A couple of air fresheners would be a good touch and curtains need a good clean too.

> **Host Response:** It's true to say, that Shorefield isn't for everyone. We have endeavoured to provide a flavour, on our page, of this well-placed cottage. Shorefield has been a well-loved home, and though a little tired, is filled with charm, character and details that point to the lifestyle of the wonderful family to whom Shorefield belongs: Well travelled and creative, keen birders and nature lovers.
>
> For us, cleanliness is a very high priority, and we will be taking your issues seriously. An odd smell can be very hard to detect when you are used to a space. As a dog-friendly cottage, we use the lovely Purdy and Figg products to help eliminate strong odours. Perhaps, it could have been a scent in their ingredients that you disagreed with.
>
> We invite guests who prefer a modern finish to consider hiring our other property on the island, Portbahn, also situated in Bruichladdich. We hope you might consider this as a more suitable option, should you visit Islay again Donna.

Die Unterkunft ist ein sehr geraumiges Haus am Meer gelegen mit herrlicher Aussich - wenn es das "schottische Wetter" erlaubt.

**Stay Duration:** 2 nights - September 2025
**Trip Type:** Group
**Reviewed:** 6 September 2025
**Score:** 4.0 - Lakens en sanitair was schoon, de rest teleurstellend

**Liked:** Het uitzicht

**Disliked:** Er was veel achterstallig onderhoud: gordijnen met gaten, vloerbedekking gescheurd, stoelen kapot, kozijnen verrot en ramen konden niet open.

> **Host Response:** Dear Arjan, whilst there are issues certainly that you have pointed to that require attention, not all are easily remedied at the height of a busy season. Replacing a window would prove too disruptive for guests and that was the call we made. We were though, able to take advantage of a small window of opportunity earlier in the season and replace the carpet in the entrance hallway for example. Be assured we will address the 'quick fix' aspects you have pointed out in your review with immediate effect, as we always do when guests are kind enough to leave their feedback, and curtains with holes are inexcusable. For that we apologise.
>
> We have made no bones about the tired condition of the house. Our description of Shorefield clearly highlights that she is a house in need of some maintenance. It is also reflected in the nightly price comparative to other similar properties on Islay. Additionally we point to our other property, Portbhan, for those guests that are more inclined toward modern living. And though she is tired, Shorefield is clean, as you so kindly pointed out. We are aware that one window that is on the side of the house that takes the brunt of the Scottish weather, is in need of attention, and this will certainly be addressed at a time appropriate to guest bookings.
>
> We recently received the happy news that our lease of Shorefield has been extended, which will allow us to proceed with a refresh over the winter months. For the time being, we hope our upcoming guests are able to see the benefit of a warm, clean, somewhat quirky but loved home, for their stay on Islay. Best wishes Arjan, and thank you again for your feedback.
