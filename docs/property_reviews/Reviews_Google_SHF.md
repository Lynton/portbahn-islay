Staying at Pi's place was the highlight of our time in Scotland. The location on Islay was within walking distance to both the Bruichladdich distillery as well as a good walk on a nice path along the water to Port Charlotte. It's quiet, but convenient to local amenities.

Great place with a view, a particularly interesting place for birders and whisky lovers. The best place to combine those hobbies with access to wildlife.
