I arrived tired and stressed but the moment I walked into this lovely home I just relaxed. Everything we needed was there and so much for the children to do between the trampoline and swings and the lovely books and jigsaws. I really enjoyed my stay and the support from Pi and Amba was fast and friendly. We only had two nights but it would be a great venue for a family holiday.

> **Response from Pi** (September 2025): This is a very thoughtful review Chris thank you. And what a weekend to travel! Wind and Water and a Wedding! Best wishes to you all, Pi & The Team.

Great views from the house. House felt like a home. Great location close to Bruichladich but the walking path is difficult to access from the house. Pi was great helping us when weather cancelled the ferrys. I would suggest having a vehicle to help you get around. Reasonable price for a very expensive Islay. Sleeps 8 with 2.5 baths.

The house was great. We had an incredible time on Islay and this was a perfect place as home base. Also better than the pictures.

We had seven in our group and everyone had comfortable space. We had time to cook one meal during our 2 night stay. The kitchen was well stocked and the dinner table was nice to sit around and enjoy a home cooked meal after a day of whisky and exploration. The beds were super comfortable too.

I certainly look forward to my next opportunity to visit and would make every effort to stay here again.

We had a wonderful family holiday at Pi's house which is a real home from home. The enclosed garden worked well for our dogs and the living space easily accommodated 6 adults. Everything you could want has been provided and it was a treat to sit in bed looking at the sea drinking a morning coffee. The house is cosy, warm, light and well furnished. Islay is as appealing as ever- a wonderful island to explore, beautiful beaches, great restaurants... And a whisky Mecca! Thank you Pi, we very much hope to return.

This was one of my favorite stays in all of Scotland. The location was gorgeous, with the windows facing the hills of Islay so we could watch the sunset. The inside was warm and cozy with the fireplace and amazing DVD collection. It was within walking distance of the Bruichladdich Distillery, so we could easily walk home after our tour. The bathrooms were modern and clean, and the kitchen and bedrooms were beautifully clean. I would highly recommend to anyone visiting.

> **Response from Pi** (September 2024): Oh Katherine, that first line! Thanks so much for this super review, truly. Portbahn was our home on Islay until our move to Jura, and we are really, really happy that our guests get to enjoy it as much as we did. Let's hope you get to come back and cosily soak up that sunset again some day soon x

Beatiful and spacious house with nice sea view. Close to Port Charlotte town and Bruichladdich distillery. Everything worked perfectly! Make sure to have your own car.

> **Response from Pi** (August 2024): Thanks Kari! We are so happy you had a great visit to Islay, and enjoyed the house. You make a good point about having your own car; having one is very handy to reach the more isolated parts of Islay. However, for guests coming to stay without a car, the island bus service is pretty useful for reaching most of the distilleries and towns, and further afield can be reached by booking a taxi. There is always the option of hiring a bicycle, with a couple of companies offering e-Bikes to rent, with drop off and collection options. Or take a whisky tour: The perfect option if you fancy a few wee drams!

We were a large group traveling together and were thrilled to find two of Pi's properties within a 3-minute walk from each other.

Unfortunately, the ferry (Calmac) changed and then canceled the ferry to Islay, so we could only stay 1 night of the 2-night minimum that was booked.

Both properties were AMAZING. I cannot stress how clean, homely, and well set-up they were. Both had clear instructions and labels. Both had awesome seafronts and views. The beds were comfy, the showers were great, lots of books to read.

Pi was the most AMAZING host. She made herself available for questions and help when we had some logistic challenges. She looked after us like family and she went over and above what normal hosts would do. I hope to return the same level of hospitality to Pi and her family one day and we cannot wait to get back to Islay.

Don't hesitate to stay at this property or any properties that are managed by Pi. You won't regret it. Simply the best location and properties on Islay!

Pi's place was everything we imagined and more. I cannot say enough good things about how lovely the place is on Islay and how peaceful it was to stay there. It was the perfect home base for the 6 of us with plenty of room, puzzles and games for the kids, clean, and comforting. It we find ourselves in Bruichladdich again, we would absolutely stay here every time! Make sure you book your ferry in plenty of time, especially if needing a car, and allow yourself time to get from one place on the island to another. Part of the appeal of Islay is the peace and slower pace, so if you're expecting to rush or get anywhere quickly, slow down and just enjoy your surroundings. It is truly such a special place.

This is a lovely, cosy home with beautiful views. It is very close to Port Charlotte where we had great meals at the hotel and the Lochindaal seafood restaurant. Our kids loved the bunk beds. The house is full of books, games, toys and lots of amenities for children such as kids dishes. We had a wonderful time here and took away nothing but happy memories of the sunsets, big skies, beautiful beaches and very helpful local people.

This is a perfect house for a young family to stay for a few days and relax and explore Islay. The view from the bedroom and living room was phenomenal looking out over the loch and across to Bowmore. We loved waking up to the view each morning. The garden and trampoline was a big hit with the kids. It is really quiet and secluded. There is a small town with a local shop handy for essentials. Bowmore is not too far with more places to explore and eat. It's a great base to explore the island. All round great place

Coming from a hot climate, we especially enjoyed being able to have a glass of wine in front of the fireplace on the cold evenings. We love Bruichladdich whiskey and gin and the short walk up to the distillery was a big bonus.

My friends and I stayed at Lynton & Pi's place as a base to explore Islay, particularly several distilleries.

Overall experience: Very positive. Thank you to the hosts, Lynton & Pi.

Communications: The hosts were extremely clear and quick in communicating before our stay, at the start, during, and at end of our stay. They kindly allowed us to leave some luggage during the day after we had checked out, as some members of our party had an evening flight off of Islay. There were also detailed instructions about how to operate different light fixtures, tv/sat box, wood, as well recommendations on places to explore around the house.

Location: Great for those who want to be near some of the distilleries. The location is just a bit outside of Port Charlotte, so you get more of a countryside experience. It's close enough to bigger towns (via car) that you feel connected to a bigger world (if you want to be).

Cleanliness and quality of unit: There was some minor damage by previous guests which limited the ability to open some windows, but this was communicated in advance and did not impact our stay at all. The house was extremely neat and tidy.

What can I say! My husband and I and our 2 Boxer dogs have had a 2 week holiday in scotland. We have stayed in 4 different Airbnb's, most have been amazing for a variety of reasons but the most memorable is Lynton & Pi's place. Reasons, well, it felt like home! Communication was great, check in and out was seamless & Pi was very helpful on our last day, the hottest day of the year!

The neighbours were very helpful and lovely too. In fact everyone we met on islay was friendly and lovely. It was a shock coming back to the mainland, I still found myself waving to say hi to police officers, post officers and in fact everyone we drove past! It's a hard habit to break!

The house is very well equipped with everything needed and we loved the fact there were lots of basic and not so basic ingredients in the house and we were more than happy to put some money into the pay it forward box. It was very helpful.

We hope to return next year so Azi and pika can enjoy their favourite beach again :-)

This is a lovely sanctuary! We woke to beautiful views of the water, bunnies on the lawn, neighboring sheep, and a sense of tranquility. We were also quite thankful for the provided black-out shades, as the summer days can make sleeping a bit more challenging!

The location is perfectly central for accessing all areas of the island.

Lynton and Pi were easy to communicate with in advance of our stay, and provided lots of helpful information.

While we spent most of our time on Islay out and about, we did enjoy our small amount of time at the house - comfortable beds, modern bath, clean and bright common area for meals. Although we did not have children in our party, the house is set up well if you are looking for kid-friendly accommodation.

We would definitely stay here again!

This place is just wonderful. We loved staying here, and the kids were disappointed when we had to leave. The space is stylish and comfortable. It was perfect for five of us, but could accommodate at least six very comfortably and can sleep even more. We loved the amazing yard and trampoline. We cooked our meals in the well stocked kitchen, and we LOVED hanging out in the living area. We walked to Bruichladdich village and distillery, and to the beach. The guest manual was extremely handy and gave us great information. Pi is super responsive and was very helpful with questions. We wish we had stayed longer!

Superb cottage and one of the best places i've stayed. I would highly recommend this cottage to anyone. Thankyou Pi for your hospitality!

Views over Loch Indaal in the morning were quite spectacular. The cottage itself has everything you need and basic cooking supplies are provided. Best place to get other ingredients is the Co-op in Bowmore on your way from the ferry. There is also a butcher and a fresh fish van in Bowmore too.

Bruichladdich and Kilchoman are the two local whisky distilleries, and offer the best tours on the island in my opinion. Bowmore also has a great tasting bar with a balcony that overlooks the loch on a sunny day.

The pub at the Port Charlotte Hotel is about a half hour walk away and we had a great 3-course evening meal in there.

Best beach walk is Machir Bay, approximately 10 min drive from the cottage. Sanaigmore Bay on the north west of the island (15 min drive) is also well worth a visit.

I also recommend heading south past Port Charlotte right to the end of the road to the village of Portnahaven. There's a great wee pub called An Tigh Seinnse and a coastal circular walk which takes about an hour and a half.

> **Response from Pi** (May 2018): Thank you so much John for your lovely, informative review, might have to steal some of that info for our house manual, great stuff. Glad you had a great time!

The kitchen was well stocked, which was convenient since we got in later and needed to pick up some groceries at the mini market in Bruichladdich. Comfortable living room area with tv equipped with plenty of channels. Pi and Lynton do a fabulous job of filling you in on local sights and eateries. The location really is ideal, since you're in a quiet spot, but very easy to get around. About 3 minutes drive to Port Charlotte (food at the hotel was delicious! But make sure to reserve ahead of time) and maybe 10 minutes to Bridgend (Lorna at the hotel is fabulous and gives wonderful recommendations for food and drinks).

This place is simply amazing. Secluded and quiet, the location is more than just beautiful. The home is modern with so many comforts you would not expect.

Be sure to visit the Bruichladdich distillery just down the street, and go to Port Charlotte. The hotel has nice food but pricey. Try the pub down the road and be sure to sample their whiskeys - there are some you will not find anywhere else in the world.

The host was easily reachable for questions and was extremely understanding when one of our party accidentally broke an item.

This is my favorite AirBnB so far after about a dozen of them. You just cannot get the same feeling and comfort from a hotel.

Lynton and Pi have a comfortable, cozy house with a beautiful view of Loch Indaal. Five of us stayed here for three days in May and loved it. Well-appointed kitchen, nice living and dining rooms, and three bedrooms gave us a nice amount of space to spread out in.

The house sits between Port Charlotte and Bruichladdich on the northern side of the island. It is fairly centrally located - Bowmore is roughly 20 minutes away by car, Caol Ila 25 and Ardbeg 40.

Communication with them was easy and they were very responsive.

One of my favorite touches was the honor-system pantry they have set up in the kitchen. It was so nice to have a little bit of food in the house when we got there.

We couldn't have asked for a more pleasant stay, and we'll definitely stay there again on our next visit to Islay.

We had the most amazing week at Pi and Lynton's gorgeous home! As two families with two babies, the house had everything and more to keep us all entertained. The open plan living space was such a lovely, light and airy space to hang out, with fantastic views out to sea. Many a moment we would gaze at the water from the kitchen island, with our boys happily playing with the toys on the rug in front. The bedrooms are very comfortable, with enormous, comfy beds and luxurious bedding. The outside space is also excellent for families, with a large decked area, huge lawn, swings, trampoline and other outdoor toys.

Although we didn't met Pi and Lynton, they have been super friendly and helpful both before and during our stay.

If you want a family-orientated, stylish, warm, clean and well situated home on Islay, definitely stay here! Thanks so much Pi and Lynton!
