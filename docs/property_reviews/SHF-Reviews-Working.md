## 3. Core Experience Pillars (What Guests Actually Value)

> **Owner context (critical):** Shorefield is the owners’ own, well-travelled family home. It is intentionally quirky and layered with real life: bird books, binoculars, sketches and watercolours, and furniture collected from Africa and Asia. Behind the house are bird hides, woodlands and wetlands the owners created. The property runs on renewables (wind turbine + solar panels) powering an Everhot stove.
>
> **Positioning truth:** This is not modern perfection. It is for guests who want character, creativity, nature, and a strong sense of place.

### Pillar A — A real home feel
“Homely”, “cosy”, “charming”, “like a favourite blanket”.

### Pillar B — Views, quiet, dark nights
Bay views, sunrise, peace, stargazing.

### Pillar C — Deceptively spacious
Much bigger than expected; multiple zones for groups.

### Pillar D — Whisky walkability
3–6 min walk to Bruichladdich; scenic walk to Port Charlotte.

### Pillar E — Hosts as differentiator
Proactive, kind, practical, especially during ferry disruption.
