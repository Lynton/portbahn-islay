The setting is beautiful, the house in every way comfortable and consistent with the description. It feels like home, it was a real pleasure. A big thank you to Pi for his proactivity when our ferry was cancelled 🙏🏻

I arrived tired and stressed but the moment I walked into this lovely home I just relaxed. Everything we needed was there and so much for the children to do between the trampoline and swings and the lovely books and jigsaws. I really enjoyed my stay and the support from Pi and Amba was fast and friendly. We only had two nights but it would be a great venue for a family holiday.

**Response from Pi (September 2025):** This is a very thoughtful review Chris thank you. And what a weekend to travel! Wind and Water and a Wedding! Best wishes to you all, Pi & The Team.

### John (San Antonio, Texas) — Group trip

- **Rating:** 5 stars  
- **When:** September 2025

Great views from the house. House felt like a home. Great location close to Bruichladich but the walking path is difficult to access from the house. Pi was great helping us when weather cancelled the ferrys. I would suggest having a vehicle to help you get around. Reasonable price for a very expensive Islay. Sleeps 8 with 2.5 baths.

### Saku (New Rochelle, New York) — Group trip

- **Rating:** 5 stars  
- **When:** September 2025

The house was great. We had an incredible time on Islay and this was a perfect place as home base. Also better than the pictures.

We had seven in our group and everyone had comfortable space. We had time to cook one meal during our 2 night stay. The kitchen was well stocked and the dinner table was nice to sit around and enjoy a home cooked meal after a day of whisky and exploration. The beds were super comfortable too.

I certainly look forward to my next opportunity to visit and would make every effort to stay here again.

**Response from Pi (September 2025):** Love this! Saku, you would be incredibly welcome to come and stay again, it was a pleasure to host you all! All the best, Pi & The Team.

### Jonathan (Québec City, Canada)

- **Rating:** 5 stars  
- **When:** September 2025

Incredible and quiet spot, could stay there full time! Everything was perfect, 5 min from bus station and distillery. Pi was very responsive and made everything easy.

**Response from Pi (September 2025):** That's as good as it gets! Guests saying they could stay forever! Thanks heaps Jonathon, and best wishes!
