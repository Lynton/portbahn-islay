November 2025

We had a wonderful stay on Islay at Pi's cottage. It was much bigger than we anticipated, which was great! Plenty of space to relax for 4 adults. The house stayed warm and you could hear the water from the bedrooms - heaven!

It is an island so lower your expectations regarding water pressure anywhere and you'll be fine. Pi was so friendly and helpful, the local seafood and whisky is incredible (Bruichladdich Distillery is not 5 minutes up the road from the cottage and was one of our favorites), so would highly recommend Shorefield as a home base to explore the island.

> **Response from Pi** (December 2025): Thank you Sophie, and very best wishes!!

We had a such fantastic stay at Shorefield House! The house was cozy and charming and just right for a couple days touring the island and located quite centrally to all the things we wanted to see and do. It had everything we needed, and Pi and Amba were great when we had questions.

> **Response from Pi** (September 2025): You were absolutely lovely to host Tara! You should come and stay at our retreat on Jura next time you visit the islands! Bothan Jura Retreat, perfect for two; hot tubs under the stars, lazy days or yomps up The Paps, sauna, gorgeous views, make your own pizza.....See you on Jura!! Best wishes, Pi & The Team

Group trip

Pi and her team were amazing. Even before we arrived, they assisted with multiple CalMac ferry rescheduling due to maintenance and weather issues.

They were angels in distress for 6 stranded American women. Helping us connect to the rental car agency, when we found that none of us could make calls except back to people in the US even though we all had purchased international phone packages. We could receive international call and they were able to get the rental agency to contact us.

Thank you to the bottom of our hearts for checking back a couple of times to be sure we were safe.

I would recommend this home and hope to be able to return one day.

For future traveler, 2 nights is not enough time to explore this beautiful and wildly remote island. The islanders are the most thoughtful, friendliest and caring people, I have met in my travels.

Thanks again.

> **Response from Pi** (September 2025): You made your mark on the verges of Islay and are now legendary on the island Debra!! You were the most wonderful guests and we would love to see you all return to Islay again one day. The very best of wishes and stay out of trouble! Pi & The Team

### Stuart

Westport, New York
*****
February 2025

We can't say enough good things about Pi and Shorefield Cottage. Shorefield is an adorable Scottish cottage that's deceptively spacious. My wife and I were the only ones staying, but six or more people could be quite comfortable there.

We really enjoyed cooking in the kitchen and the bed was nice and comfy. It was such a treat to look out the window and see the waves crashing on the shore.

This cottage is close to Port Charlotte and only a six minute walk from Bruichladdich Distillery.

Lastly, Pi was a truly remarkable hostess. We ran into a number of major snags (unrelated to the Airbnb) with our travel plans and she went above and beyond to help us.

We will absolutely stay at Shorefield (or one of Pi's cottages) again because we had such an overwhelmingly positive experience!

> **Response from Amba & Pi** (February 2025): Wow Stuart, this is a really wonderful review! I know some of the details of your trip, even though I wasn't a 'visible' part of your visit to Islay. As someone who has only recently begun working for Team Pi & Lynton, I couldn't agree more with your praise for Pi, she undoubtedly sets the bar very high with her attention to the needs of our guests!! Thank you both once again for being such lovely guests. You and Erin would absolutely be welcome back, and we would all hope for a smoother time of things the next time! Best of wishes, Amba (& Pi)

Had a lovely stay, house is in a beautiful area with amazing views. The house felt homely and was great for a family of 6 with a dog - lots of room to hang out and play games! The location is perfect for exploring the rest of Islay and the ferry ports are only about 30mins drive away. At night we could stargaze and the Loch Indaal Way is right on the doorstep, with some hidden beaches!

### Peter

May 2024

Nice Cottage perfect for a private quiet stay when drivning around Islay. Everything you need is in the kitchen. No restaurant within walking distance but very close to The Bruichladdich Distillery and a small store. Half an hour walking to the small village of Port Charlotte.

> **Response from Pi** (May 2024): Dear Peter, you were really lovely, mindful guests whom we would welcome back tomorrow! Much appreciated, thank you! A Note for Readers: Peter is right with regards to there not being a restaurant within a short walking distance. Though, if one is of a mind to take a 30-minute (Peter is spot-on) stroll back home after lunch or supper, and if the weather plays kind, you can eat at the Port Charlotte Hotel, or Lochindaal Seafood Kitchen.

We enjoyed our stay here. It's a "homely" house with some character. Easy to find and Pi the owner was very helpful, even organised some groceries for us. One room had two single beds, I would recommend singles in all rooms with the option to join the beds to create a double bed if renters should want to have this.

> **Response from Pi** (April 2024): What a sweet description of Shorefield Atul, thank you so much. We welcome your suggestion with regards to the arrangement of beds, and will give this due consideration. Happy travels!

### Sara

April 2024
Stayed with kids

Shorefield Cottage was a perfect stay for our family vacation on Islay. This was our second time on the island, and the first time with our two daughters.

The house was perfectly arranged where we felt at home as soon as we walked in the door. The kitchen was well suited for cooking meals, the living room was comfortable for evening movies, the beds were comfortable, and the bathroom was clean. Many toys too!

The location was prime for us as we didn't want to be in one of the larger cities, but close to many sites. We were walking distance to Bruichladdich, where we enjoyed the distillery and mini market + cafe. We enjoyed walks down in Portnahaven, Machir Bay, Saligo Bay, and Loch Gruinart. We went to the larger grocery in Bowmore for produce. We enjoyed meals out at Port Mor Community Center (plus the playground next to it), and in Bowmore.

All that said, the house was beautiful plus well suited for a family with young kids. Highly recommend a stay at Shorefield.

> **Response from Pi** (April 2024): So pleased your little family had such a good stay, Sara. And a busy one at that! It is a super house for children to play in. Thank you so much for choosing us!

Group trip

We were a large group traveling together and were thrilled to find two of Pi's properties within 3 3-minute walk from each other.

Unfortunately, the ferry (Calmac) changed and then canceled the ferry to Islay, so we could only stay 1 night of the 2-night minimum that was booked.

Both properties were AMAZING. I cannot stress how clean, homely, and well set-up they were. Both had clear instructions and labels. Both had awesome seafronts and views. The beds were comfy, the showers were great, lots of books to read.

Pi was the most AMAZING host. She made herself available for questions and help when we had some logistic challenges. She looked after us like family and she went over and above what normal hosts would do. I hope to return the same level of hospitality to Pi and her family one day and we cannot wait to get back to Islay.

Don't hesitate to stay at this property or any properties that are managed by Pi. You won't regret it. Simply the best location and properties on Islay!

Staying at Pi's place was the highlight of our time in Scotland. The location on Islay was within walking distance to both the Bruichladdich distillery as well as a good walk on a nice path along the water to Port Charlotte. It's quiet, but perfect for what we were looking for. The house was cozy and we felt right at home in the nice large kitchen. Beds were very comfortable as well. Pi was very communicative when there was a small issue with the fireplace. We'd love to come back and spend more time here!

### Richard

August 2023

Shorefield is located overlooking Loch Indaal with the eastern shore and the Paps of Jura as a stunning backdrop.

The cottage itself is spacious: a separate dining room, and a breakfast table in the kitchen.

The cottage is well located to explore Islay with The Oa peninsula (and RSPB Reserve) the furthest location away at a 40 minute drive. A day trip to Jura is straightforward and makes for an excellent day out.

Pi resolved a minor issue (no blinds on velux windows in twin bedroom) phenomenally quickly which was impressive. It is recommended that future guests bring an eye mask if they are sensitive to daylight.

The cottage is rather cluttered with the owners books, maps and other artefacts, and the carpets could do with being replaced. Unfortunately the TV didn't work other than the smart option (eg Netflix & iPlayer) and no DVD player. But if you intend to spend most time away, and weather is good, not a problem. WiFi connection was very good.

> **Response from Pi** (September 2023): Thanks for your feedback Richard, shame about the 3 stars. Some people love the quaintness of the owners bird books, art materials, maps and world travel momentos. Personal taste I guess. The tv's DVD player is in the side of the TV I will amend the manual to reflect that. Whilst your private feedback also had extensive issues with the house not having a dishwasher, was a bit shabby and more investement needed it is worth noting that your dog killed a pheasant in our front room and ruined a pair of curtains that had blood all over them and had also got into our drying room cocked its leg and p**sed all over a basket of full of clean laundry!

The Shorefield House is a peaceful venue which is in the perfect location for fans of Bruichladdich Whiskey which is a mere 5 minutes walk from the Distillery. The house has ample space for 6 people and there are various rooms and lounges where you can sit and relax without getting into each others space. A great place to stay on Islay.

Very peaceful, comfortable and perfectly located base for a stay on Islay. Superb kitchen equipment and facilities. Really comfortable beds. Environmentally conscious heating system keeps the temperature at a steady comfortable level throughout. Easy check in and out. Communication with host was clear, quick and helpful at all times. Highly appreciated and recommended.

Shorefield is a great place from which to explore Islay. Lovely, cosy house with everything you need plus lovely views out over the coast. Pi is a great host and met us on arrival and gave us lots of hints and tips to get the most out of our trip.

This house was like visiting an old Auntie's house - in a good way. Lots of comfortable spaces, full of doo-dads and Knick knacks, plenty of food in the cupboard and nice extras like rubber boots, hats and sweaters in case of bad weather. The location was great. Super close to Bruichladdich (a two minute walk!) and also close to Port Charlotte. The views are priceless! Overall it's a perfect place to stay on Islay.

Pi's place had a one-of-a-kind atmosphere and location. It's filled with unique pieces of art and other quirky and cozy touches. We loved seeing the sheep next door and lighting a fire outside in the fire-pit. Would highly recommend/stay again!

We had a great time. The place and our host, Pi, were outstanding. In face we are already talking about making another trip to Islay... and will certainly be knocking Pi's door to host us.

Amazing place to stay on the shores of dramatic and magical Islay. The house is lovely with a very large open kitchen suitable for cooking and spending time with a large group - several windows let in plenty of natural light and the kitchen is fairly well equipped. Washer and dryer are on premise which can be conocimiento if caught in the Islay rain! It's fairly easy with a taxi service to get around the island (groceries, distilleries, ferries) and the Bruichladdich plant is less than a ten minute walk away. I'd say the sleeping situation was comfortable for five singles or two singles and two couples. Wonderful value for the money.
