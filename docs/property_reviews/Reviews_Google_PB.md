Spacious and homely with beautiful views. Great walk to Port Charlotte and beautiful beach on your doorstep. Extras like the coffee pods & kitchen store cupboard ingredients really appreciated. Huge master bedroom with views across the loch, we wished we had stayed longer!

A home from home for all the family. Our age ranges where 62 to 1 year old and house accommodated for us all. Plenty for the kids as the garden is huge. We will definitely be back... we love Islay and are now glad to have found this gem of a place to stay.

> **Host Response (5 months ago):**
> Thank you Jane and family. We would love to you have back!

Man oh man what a magical place Islay is. We stayed here for 3 nights and loved it. This location was right next to Bruichladdich distillers and not far from either ferry. We appreciated the beautiful views and the very well stocked kitchen. Thank for making your home so homey!

> **Host Response (10 months ago):**
> This is such a bubbly review Katie, and we really appreciate it, thank you!

Portbahn Cottage was fantastic, better than the online photos! The view from the front windows was heavenly, from back windows we saw lambs up the hill each day. All beds were very comfortable. We hosted a large dinner after a family memorial - there was plenty of room for everyone to enjoy their meal. The weather was decent so we were able to use the deck area as well. Pi has a very special place to enjoy if schedules work out.

My wife, son and I stayed for 5 days in Dec. The cottage was cozy and comfortable. We enjoyed the views of Loch Indaal, walked to Port Charlotte and Bruchladich and made the short drives to several distilleries. It was a very relaxing and wonderful trip. We hope to be back again soon.

> **Host Response (a year ago):**
> Thanks James. We hope you are able to return to Islay soon soon, and look forward to welcoming you all back to Portbahn!

Lovely spacious cottage with everything you need for an enjoyable stay. Great to have books, DVDs and games for those showery spells. Very comfortable and would definitely book again if we return to Islay. Very handy for west coast beaches and recommend the coffee and bacon rolls at the Bruichladdich mini mart! Online guidebook for the cottage with recommendations for where to eat was most welcome. Thanks for sharing your lovely house.

> **Host Response (a year ago):**
> Lovely to have you come stay and we're glad you enjoyed the food and drink at Aileen's Mini Market in Bruichladdich!

We had a wonderful stay at PortBahn for Hogmanay. It is a beautiful property, in a great location and equipped with anything and everything you could ask for to make a family holiday perfect. The house was really warm and cosy. The owner, Pi was so accommodating and helpful and really couldn't have been any kinder. We loved our stay and would 100% recommend! Thank you Pi

Would absolutely recommend this lovely home to anyone wanting to visit Islay. The home is beautiful, peaceful, quiet, and cozy. There was plenty of room for 6 of us with puzzles and games for the kids, seating for all, and scenery you could stare at for hours. Bruichladdich is a wonderful place and we hope to visit Islay again in the future. We would be happy to rent the Portbahn Cottage again and again! Highly recommend!

Make sure to book your ferry to Islay in advance, especially if you plan to bring a car, and be prepared to sloooooow down and enjoy the peace of Islay.

> **Host Response (a year ago):**
> Yes good advice to book the ferries, and we're glad you enjoyed the house and the kids all the books and games.

A lovely location and stay at Portbahn cottage. Great facilities and so comfortable with high quality linen and bedding etc. Seven of us stayed for a two day event and all very comfortable in the Cottage. High quality fittings and fixtures with wonderful views from the spacious open plan lounge/kitchen area. Will be our first choice for a return stay.
