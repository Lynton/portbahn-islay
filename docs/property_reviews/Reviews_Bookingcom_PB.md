- **Stay Duration:** 3 nights, October 2025
- **Trip Type:** Family
- **Date:** 30 October 2025
- **Score:** 9.0
- **Title:** Would definitely recommend and would love to come back.

**Liked:**
Lovely and spacious with lots of extras such as coffee machine etc. Would definitely recommend.

**Disliked:**
Only criticism and this is more of a me problem than the house. I have mobility issues and struggled a bit going up the stairs to enter the house and also some of the furniture was a bit on the low side, but as I said this was more my problem than any criticism of the house.

> **Host Response:** A lovely review, and useful to others in a similar situation.

**Liked:**
The location is beautiful and there is a wonderful path in front of the house which is perfect for morning runs or walks. The home is very comfortable and communication with the host was easy.

**Disliked:**
The tile in the master bath had some mold, and the room had a musty smell at times. We didn't notice anything like that in the rest of the house.

> **Host Response:** Almost a glowing report! Thank you for mentioning the issue - we have addressed it.

- **Title:** Good

**Disliked:**
Second room (double) had no curtains, blinds see through so when the sun came up at 5am i wasnt able to rest, literally the only thing thats needs adjusting in this place otherwise it was excellent

> **Host Response:** Oh what a shame you didn't notice the Black Out blinds Ryan! Being quite far north, the Scottish summer nights are incredibly short! All the bedrooms are provided with temporary Black Outs to aid a restful nights sleep. Particularly after a wee dram or two! As other guests find they rather enjoy being 'up with the lark', we have made it so that the blinds can be installed, or removed as necessary. When not in use, they are stored either in a draw or the cupboard within the bedrooms. Best wishes Ryan, and thanks heaps for the 'Excellent'!!

**Liked:**
The house is set on the beautiful coastline so the views are amazing all the time! It's so peaceful, with a huge enclosed garden so we don't have to worry about the dogs. It had all the amenities we needed and more to have a super relaxing and comfortable stay. Something I thought was a massive extra mile factor was there was an inhaler in the property - as someone with with bad asthma, that could've been a life saver should something had happened to mine!

We visited as a family and loved every second!

**Disliked:**
Nothing!

> **Host Response:** Playing catch up on replying to Reviews Poppy, and this was a wonderful one to read.

The host Pi communicated clearly with us from the beginning. The day before arrival he asked if we would mind staying in the Shorefiled house just down the street because work was being done on the Portbahn house. Pi refunded us the difference in price and the Shorefield house was charming and a lovely place to stay.

Excellent communication from the host prior to our stay. The cottage is very well equiped to meet most traveller's needs. Large size rooms. Plenty of parking space. Spectacular panoramic views across Islay.

**Disliked:**
It would be helpful there was a tumble clothes dryer in the laundry for longer stays as the drying racks are inadequate for thick clothing, socks etc. on cold days.
