# Mentions vs Citations
*(Why being talked about matters more than being linked)*

## TL;DR
Mentions shape understanding.
Citations reinforce authority.

Both matter — but they behave differently.

---

## 1. Mentions build familiarity

Mentions:
- Appear without links
- Reinforce brand/entity presence
- Shape model confidence

AI systems learn:
> “This entity appears frequently in this context.”

---

## 2. Citations build trust

Citations:
- Are explicit attributions
- Signal reliability
- Often require higher confidence

Citations are harder to earn — and more brittle.

---

## 3. The interplay

Mentions often:
- Precede citations
- Enable recognition
- Reduce perceived risk

A cited entity is usually:
- Already frequently mentioned elsewhere

---

## 4. Practical guidance

We optimise for:
- Correct, consistent mentions
- Citations where appropriate
- Broad presence, not just links
