# Entity Consistency and Drift
*(How small inconsistencies quietly destroy AI confidence â€” without killing human tone)*

## TL;DR
AI systems reward **consistency of identity**, not uniformity of language.

Entity drift happens when:
- Core facts change
- Scope shifts
- Relationships blur

Entity drift does **not** happen because:
- Language is varied
- Tone is human
- Emotional or sensory description is used

The goal is semantic stability with expressive freedom.

## 1. What entity drift actually is

Entity drift occurs when the same real-world thing is represented inconsistently at the **identity level**.

Examples:
- Different names for the same entity
- Conflicting descriptions of what it *is*
- Shifting location, scope, or purpose
- Multiple pages claiming primary authority

Each introduces ambiguity into the entity graph.

---

## 2. Why drift is so damaging to AI systems

LLMs must resolve conflicts probabilistically.

When signals disagree:
- Confidence drops
- Conservative phrasing is chosen
- Citations are avoided
- Generic synthesis increases

From the systemâ€™s perspective:
> Ambiguity equals risk.

## 3. Consistency is not uniformity (critical distinction)

This is the most important clarification.

**Consistency applies to identity, not expression.**

You should:
- Keep names, attributes, and relationships stable
- Vary language, tone, and descriptive phrasing
- Use rich, human language freely

You should not:
- Change what the entity *is*
- Blur category boundaries
- Introduce metaphor where definition is required

AI systems expect linguistic variation â€” as long as the underlying meaning remains stable.

## 4. Identity layer vs narrative layer

Think in two layers:

### Fixed identity layer (must not drift)
- Entity name
- Entity type
- Location
- Core attributes
- Primary relationships

### Flexible narrative layer (should vary)
- Emotional language
- Sensory description
- Perspective shifts
- Storytelling
- Human warmth

Problems arise when these layers are mixed or confused.

## 5. Where drift most commonly originates

High-risk zones:
- Hero headlines replacing clarity with poetry
- About sections subtly redefining scope
- Introductions that imply a different category
- Schema contradicting prose
- Anchor text using inconsistent naming

These are not â€œbad writingâ€ â€” they are unanchored writing.

---

## 6. Drift compounds in multi-site ecosystems

Drift is amplified when:
- Multiple domains are involved
- Content is produced over time
- Different authors contribute
- Templates evolve independently

This makes proactive consistency essential in multi-site strategies like ours.

---

## 7. Preventing drift in practice

Effective controls:
- Canonical entity definitions
- Stable naming conventions
- Reused schema identifiers
- Editorial reference points
- Periodic consistency reviews

Consistency is a system property, not a stylistic one.

---

## 8. Practical guidance for this project

We will:
- Be boring once, and beautiful everywhere else
- Anchor every entity with a clear factual spine
- Allow expressive freedom around that anchor
- Treat inconsistency as technical debt

Before publishing, ask:
> â€œIf I removed the emotional language, would the entity still be unmistakable?â€

---

## 9. Mental shortcut

If two pages:
- Feel consistent to a human
- But define the entity differently

An AI system will trust neither.

---

## 10. Working definition

**Entity Drift**  
> The degradation of entity clarity caused by inconsistent representation of identity-level facts across content, pages, or domains â€” not by variation in tone or expression.
