# Page Design for AI Search
*(How individual pages should be structured)*

## Purpose
Ensure every page is a strong retrieval and synthesis candidate.

---

## Page structure
1. Clear entity definition early
2. Supporting attributes and relationships
3. Question-led sections
4. Human narrative and imagery

---

## Design principles
- Pages are containers for passages
- Headings are extraction anchors
- Emotion follows clarity

---

## 3. Breadth vs Depth

Query fan-out rewards pages that combine:
- Deep coverage of a primary entity
- Light coverage of adjacent concepts

This supports AI systems generating multiple internal queries from one user prompt.

### Query fan-out validates this approach

Research from iPullRank shows AI systems generate:
- **10.7 queries per prompt** (average)
- **Up to 28 synthetic queries** per prompt
- **95% of these queries have NO search volume**
- **Average query length: 6.7 words** (highly specific)

**What this means:**  
Traditional keyword research misses the vast majority of queries AI systems actually use.

### Domain saturation effect

**iPullRank data:**
- Appearing once: **9.7% citation rate**
- Appearing 7+ times: **80%+ citation rate**

When multiple fan-out queries find the same source, the system builds confidence.

**Query overlap:**
- 66-68% of what each query finds is also found by other queries
- Sources found by all 3 queries: 9.5% of citations (high-consensus authorities)

### No position bias

Unlike traditional search, fan-out queries show no position bias:
- Query 1 results: ~21-22% overlap
- Query 5 results: ~21-22% overlap
- Query 10 results: ~21-22% overlap

**p-value: 0.54** (no statistical difference)

Rankings 1, 5, and 10 contribute equally.

This is why **retrieval probability matters more than ranking position**.

### Multi-query coverage goal

A well-designed entity page should naturally satisfy multiple fan-out queries by:
- Covering primary entity comprehensively
- Including adjacent concepts briefly
- Using consistent terminology across variations
- Providing unique, authoritative data

**Testing coverage:**  
Ask: "Could this page reasonably be retrieved for 5-10 related queries?"

If no → too narrow or too vague.

---

### In practice

**Go deep on the core entity:**
- Exhaustive attributes
- Clear differentiation
- Multiple extraction angles
- Comprehensive supporting detail

**Go light on adjacent topics:**
- Just enough to be retrievable for fan-out queries
- Brief context or summary
- Link to deeper resources where they exist

---

### Strategic application

**For property pages (e.g., Portbahn House):**
- **Deep:** Property specifications, facilities, booking, house rules
- **Light:** Local area overview, nearby attractions (with links to guide pages)
- **Result:** Page ranks for property-specific queries AND adjacent discovery queries

**For guide pages (e.g., Machir Bay beach):**
- **Deep:** The specific beach, access, features, safety
- **Light:** Nearby beaches, general Islay beach overview (with links)
- **Result:** Page ranks for focused queries AND broader category exploration

**For hub pages:**
- **Moderate depth across multiple topics**
- Each section targets a cluster of fan-out queries
- Internal linking creates coherent exploration paths

---

### Avoid

- Extreme narrowness that orphans the page from related queries
- Shallow breadth without a clear primary focus (becomes "AI slop")
- Competing with stronger authorities on their core topics

---

### When in doubt

- Go deep where you are the primary authority
- Go light where stronger sources exist
- Link generously to those stronger sources

This increases trust and supports query fan-out without diluting your core authority.

---

## 4. What to avoid
- Multiple primary entities
- Buried definitions
- Clever-but-vague headlines

---

**Outcome:** Pages that survive extraction without losing humanity.
