# Entity Mapping Workflow
*(How to decide what deserves a page)*

## Purpose
Prevent page sprawl and entity confusion.

---

## Workflow
1. List candidate entities
2. Validate real-world distinctness
3. Assign canonical ownership
4. Decide representation type:
   - Primary page
   - Supporting section
   - Mention only

---

## Rules
- One entity = one canonical page
- Everything else supports it
- No page without an entity purpose

---

**Outcome:** A clean, durable entity system.
