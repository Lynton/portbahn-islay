# Writing for Passage Extraction
*(Fixed spine, flexible skin)*

## TL;DR
Write for **machines to extract** and **humans to feel**.

The solution is not robotic writing.
The solution is **structured humanity**.

---

## 1. The false trade-off

A common fear:
> "If we optimise for AI, the content will feel robotic."

This only happens when:
- Identity and narrative are confused
- Structure is mistaken for rigidity
- Consistency is mistaken for repetition

Good AI-era writing is:
> Clear at the core, expressive at the edges.

---

## 2. Fixed spine, flexible skin (core principle)

Every important section should have:

### A fixed spine
- One clear idea
- One defined entity or concept
- Explicit attributes or assertions
- Unambiguous scope

This is what AI systems extract.

### A flexible skin
- Emotional language
- Sensory detail
- Human perspective
- Narrative colour

This is what humans connect with.

---

## 3. Designing passages for extraction

Strong passages:
- Answer one question
- Define one thing
- Make one assertion

Weak passages:
- Wander across ideas
- Depend on surrounding context
- Introduce ambiguity

A passage should survive being lifted out of the page.

---

## 4. Where to put the spine

The spine should appear:
- Early in the section
- In plain language
- Without metaphor

Once the spine is established:
- You are free to elaborate creatively

Be boring first. Be beautiful second.

---

## 5. Emotional language without ambiguity

Emotional and sensory language works when:
- It layers on top of facts
- It does not redefine scope
- It does not replace definitions

Avoid:
- Metaphors that change category
- Vague superlatives without anchors
- Poetic language in defining sentences

---

## 6. Headings as contracts

A heading is a promise.

It tells:
- Humans what they are about to read
- Machines what the passage contains

Headings should:
- Be descriptive
- Match the passage content exactly
- Avoid cleverness that obscures meaning

---

## 7. Practical guidance for this project

When writing or reviewing content, we will:

- Define the spine explicitly
- Check passages in isolation
- Allow narrative freedom after clarity
- Prefer clarity over cleverness in anchors

Before finalising a section, ask:
> "Could an AI system extract this and still be correct?"

---

## 8. Mental shortcut

If a section:
- Feels beautiful
- But cannot be summarised plainly

It is not ready.

---

## 9. Working definition

**Passage Writing (for AI search)**  
> The practice of structuring content so that each section contains a clear, extractable core of meaning, surrounded by expressive language that enhances human connection without introducing ambiguity.

---

## 10. The semantic triple pattern

When writing defining statements or key facts, structure them as explicit semantic triples.

**Pattern:**  
[Subject] [Predicate] [Object]

This isn't about rigid formality. It's about clarity of assertion.

**Examples:**

**Property definition:**
- ✅ "Portbahn House is a self-catering holiday home on Islay"
- ❌ "A beautiful property offering accommodation"

**Location assertion:**
- ✅ "The cottage sits 5 minutes from Bruichladdich village"
- ❌ "Conveniently located near local amenities"

**Capacity statement:**
- ✅ "The property sleeps 8 guests across 4 bedrooms"
- ❌ "Plenty of space for groups"

**Why this works:**
- Knowledge graphs are constructed from triples
- AI systems parse for subject-predicate-object relationships
- Extraction reliability increases
- Ambiguity decreases

**When to use:**
- Entity definitions
- Attribute statements
- Relationship assertions
- Key facts

**When NOT to use:**
- Narrative sections
- Emotional content
- Sensory descriptions
- Transition paragraphs

**Remember:** Fixed spine (triples), flexible skin (expression).

**Practical technique:**

Before publishing a defining sentence, check:
1. Can I identify the subject?
2. Can I identify the predicate?
3. Can I identify the object?

If yes to all three → the sentence is clear.  
If no to any → rewrite for clarity.
