# Relevance Engineering vs Traditional SEO
*(Why the old model breaks in AI search)*

## TL;DR
Traditional SEO optimised **pages to rank**.  
AI search systems optimise **information to retrieve, interpret, and synthesise**.

Modern visibility is not about being the best page â€” itâ€™s about being the **best source of meaning**.

---

## 1. Why â€œSEOâ€ is now the wrong abstraction

Classic SEO assumed a relatively stable pipeline:

```
Query â†’ Index â†’ Rank pages â†’ User clicks
```

Most optimisation effort focused on keywords, backlinks, page-level relevance, and CTR.

AI-powered discovery systems (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, etc.) do **not** primarily rank pages. They:
1. Retrieve candidate information
2. Extract relevant passages
3. Interpret meaning across sources
4. Synthesize answers

Across *Search Matrix*, *Mike King / iPullRank*, *BrightonSEO AI Search*, and *Semrush Zeroâ€‘Click*, the same conclusion appears:

> **The unit of competition is no longer the page. It is the idea, passage, or entity.**

## 2. From SEO to Relevance Engineering

**Relevance Engineering** is a more accurate term for modern optimisation.

| Traditional SEO | Relevance Engineering |
|---|---|
| Optimise pages | Optimise meaning |
| Keywords | Entities & relationships |
| Rankings | Retrieval + citation |
| Clicks | Visibility & influence |
| Pages as assets | Passages as assets |

*(Framing consistent with Search Matrix & Mike King â€“ Tech SEO Connect)*

Relevance Engineering asks:
- Can this information be retrieved?
- Will it be understood correctly?
- Is it trustworthy enough to cite?
- Does it reinforce the right entity relationships?

## 3. How AI search â€œseesâ€ content

AI systems consume:
- **Chunks** (passages, sections)
- **Embeddings** (semantic vectors)
- **Entities** (people, places, brands, concepts)
- **Relationships** (who relates to what, and how)

Implications:
- Pages are decomposed
- Context is reconstructed
- Navigation and prose are stripped away
- Only *extractable meaning* survives

> â€œEach passage should make sense on its own â€” thatâ€™s how LLMs read and reuse content.â€  
> â€” Sergei Rogulin, *Semrush Zeroâ€‘Click Playbook*

## 4. Rankings still matter â€” differently

Google still crawls, indexes, and ranks.  
But ranking is now:
- a **retrieval signal**, not the end goal
- one input among many
- often invisible to the end user

What matters more:
- Inclusion in AI answer sets
- Citations and mentions
- Influence on followâ€‘up branded searches

*(Observed across Semrush Zeroâ€‘Click data and iPullRank research)*

---

## 5. Visibility vs traffic (mental reset)

Traffic flattening â‰  performance decline.

Across multiple sources:
- Discovery happens earlier
- Influence precedes clicks
- AI visibility is partially unmeasurable in GA

New signals:
- AI citations
- Brand mentions
- Inclusion in comparisons (â€œbest X for Yâ€)
- Growth in branded search
- Assisted conversions

> **Be the source that shapes decisions â€” even if the click comes later, or elsewhere.**

---

## 6. Consequence for site builds

We are not just rebuilding pages.

We are:
- Designing an entityâ€‘aware information system
- Structuring content for passage retrieval
- Defining relationships across sites
- Engineering relevance across discovery surfaces

IA, page design, schema, content, and internal linking all flow from this model.

---

## 7. Working definition

**Relevance Engineering**  
> The practice of designing, structuring, and distributing information so that AIâ€‘driven retrieval systems can accurately find, interpret, and reuse it â€” reinforcing correct entity understanding and brand authority.
