# Schema Decision Tree
*(When to use schema — and when not to)*

## Purpose
Prevent schema bloat and misuse.

---

## Decision logic
Ask:
1. Is the entity clearly defined in content?
2. Is there ambiguity to remove?
3. Will schema reinforce relationships?

If no → do not add schema.

---

## High-value schema
- Place / LocalBusiness
- Organisation
- Person
- Article (about entities)
- FAQ (only when genuine)

---

**Outcome:** Schema that clarifies instead of confuses.
