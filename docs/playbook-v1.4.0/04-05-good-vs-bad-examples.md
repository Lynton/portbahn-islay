# Good vs Bad Examples
*(Seeing the difference makes it obvious)*

## TL;DR
Examples expose ambiguity faster than rules.

---

## Example 1: Entity definition

### Weak
> “A magical retreat offering unforgettable moments.”

### Strong
> “A small-group wellness retreat on the Isle of Jura focused on guided nature experiences and restorative stays.”

---

## Example 2: Passage design

### Weak
Long paragraph mixing location, history, feelings, and logistics.

### Strong
Separate chunks:
- What the place is
- Where it is
- What happens there
- How it feels

---

## Example 3: Question-led

### Weak
> “Our experience”

### Strong
> “What happens during a typical retreat stay?”

---

## Takeaway

Clarity first.
Expression second.
Both matter.
