# Multi-Site Coordination Rules
*(Keeping three sites semantically aligned)*

## Purpose
Ensure the ecosystem reinforces itself instead of fragmenting.

---

## Coordination principles
- Shared entity definitions
- Clear intent ownership per site
- Cross-linking as reinforcement, not duplication

---

## What each site should do
- Own distinct questions
- Reinforce shared entities
- Avoid competing representations

---

## Domain saturation for AI visibility

Recent research shows a clear correlation between domain presence and citation probability:

**iPullRank data:**
- 1 appearance in search results: **9.7% citation rate**
- 7+ appearances in search results: **80%+ citation rate**

### For our three-site ecosystem

This creates a compounding advantage:
- **Isle of Jura site** = authoritative hub for Jura entities
- **BJR** = supporting authority for Jura accommodation
- **PBI** = supporting authority for Islay accommodation

When AI systems generate fan-out queries, our ecosystem appears multiple times across different result sets.

### Strategic implications

**1. Coordinated coverage**

Each site covers different aspects of overlapping queries.

**Example:** "Isle of Jura accommodation"
- isleofjura.scot: comprehensive directory
- bothanjuraretreat.co.uk: specific property details
- **Result:** 2+ appearances from our ecosystem

---

**2. Cross-domain reinforcement**

- Sites citing each other strengthens entity definitions
- Consistent terminology increases saturation effect
- Reduces ambiguity across retrieval attempts

---

**3. Query cluster targeting**

Different sites can target different query intents.

**Example:** "things to do Isle of Jura"
- isleofjura.scot: authoritative guide hub
- bothanjuraretreat.co.uk: guest perspective / activities near properties
- **Result:** Multiple entry points for related queries

---

### Avoid

- Duplicate content across sites
- Competing for identical queries with identical content
- Inconsistent entity definitions

---

### Goal

Create an ecosystem where fan-out queries naturally find multiple complementary sources from our domains.

**Result:** Build confidence through coordinated saturation rather than fragmentation.

**Example scenario:**

User prompt: "Plan a trip to Isle of Jura"

AI generates 12 fan-out queries:
- Q1: "Isle of Jura accommodation options"
- Q3: "Things to do Isle of Jura"
- Q5: "How to get to Isle of Jura"
- Q7: "Self-catering cottages Jura"
- Q9: "Jura distillery visits"
- Q11: "Jura hiking trails"
- ...and 6 more

Our ecosystem appears across 7+ of these queries:
- isleofjura.scot: Q1, Q3, Q5, Q9, Q11
- bothanjuraretreat.co.uk: Q1, Q7
- Result: **80%+ citation probability** vs 9.7% for single appearance

---

## Ongoing maintenance
- Periodic entity drift checks
- Schema ID consistency reviews
- Narrative alignment reviews
- Domain saturation audits (query overlap analysis)

---

**Outcome:** One ecosystem, not three disconnected sites.
