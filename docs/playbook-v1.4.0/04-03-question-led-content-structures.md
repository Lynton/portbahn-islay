# Question-Led Content Structures
*(Designing content around real questions)*

## TL;DR
AI systems retrieve answers, not essays.

Question-led content aligns:
- User intent
- Passage extraction
- Answer synthesis

---

## 1. Why questions matter

Questions:
- Define scope
- Frame retrieval
- Anchor passages

AI systems often:
- Rewrite queries into questions
- Retrieve answers directly

Content that mirrors this structure:
> Is easier to reuse.

## 2. Good question formats

Effective question headings:
- What is…?
- How does…?
- Why does…?
- Where is…?
- When should…?

Avoid vague prompts:
- “Overview”
- “Things to know”
- “More information”

---

## 3. Answer structure that works

Strong answers:
- Lead with the answer
- Elaborate briefly
- Avoid suspense

Bad answers:
- Bury the answer
- Meander
- Assume prior reading

---

## 4. Latent Follow-Up Intent Mapping

For every primary question a page answers, identify:
- What would a human naturally ask next?
- What clarification would reduce uncertainty?
- What decision does this question precede?

Structure sections so:
- Primary answers come first
- Follow-up clarification comes immediately after
- Adjacent questions are grouped, not scattered

This mirrors how AI systems expand one user prompt into multiple internal queries.

**Example:**

Primary question: "Where is Portbahn House?"
→ Latent follow-up: "How do I get there?"

Primary question: "How many does it sleep?"
→ Latent follow-up: "What are the sleeping arrangements?"

Primary question: "Can I bring my dog?"
→ Latent follow-up: "Is there outdoor space for dogs?"

**In practice:**

When designing content, explicitly map:
1. The primary question this section answers
2. The natural follow-up question it creates
3. Whether the next section addresses that follow-up

If there's a gap in the sequence:
- Add a brief transition or
- Reorder sections to close the gap

This creates conversational coherence that supports both human comprehension and AI synthesis.

## 5. Human tone still matters

Question-led does not mean robotic.

You can:
- Use warmth
- Use imagery
- Use story

Just don’t delay clarity.

---

## 6. Practical guidance

Before writing a section:
- Write the question first
- Then answer it plainly
- Then enrich it
