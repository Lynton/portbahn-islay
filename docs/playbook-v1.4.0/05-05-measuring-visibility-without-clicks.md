# Measuring Visibility Without Clicks
*(Sanity in a low-attribution world)*

## TL;DR
You cannot measure zero-click influence perfectly.

You can measure **signals of impact**.

---

## 1. Why GA is insufficient

Analytics tools:
- Do not see AI answers
- Miss off-site influence
- Overweight last-click events

This creates false negatives.

---

## 2. Proxy signals that matter

Useful indicators:
- Growth in branded search
- Increase in direct traffic
- Mentions and citations
- Assisted conversions
- Qualitative feedback

---

## 3. Trend over precision

Direction matters more than exact attribution.

Look for:
- Sustained movement
- Correlated changes
- Pattern consistency

---

## 4. Practical guidance

We evaluate:
- Visibility holistically
- Over time
- Across multiple signals
