# Brand Narrative Control
*(Preventing AI systems from telling the wrong story)*

## TL;DR
If you do not define your narrative, AI systems will infer one.

Inference is rarely flattering.

---

## 1. How narratives form

AI narratives emerge from:
- Repeated descriptions
- Common comparisons
- Dominant attributes
- External sources

Once formed, narratives are sticky.

---

## 2. Common narrative failures

Typical problems:
- Being framed as a generic option
- Being miscategorised
- Being compared incorrectly
- Losing differentiation

These are hard to reverse.

---

## 3. Controlling the narrative

Narrative control comes from:
- Consistent positioning
- Clear differentiation
- Repeated framing
- Aligned messaging across surfaces

---

## 4. Practical guidance

We must:
- Define what we are
- Define what we are not
- Reinforce that everywhere
