### Block 1: `ferry-basics`

**Entity Type:** Travel
**Canonical Home:** `/travel-to-islay`
**Teaser Used On:** Homepage, Property pages

#### Full Version

Travel to Islay is not straightforward. You don't come to the Scottish islands if you want easy! You come because of the adventure and for an experience you can't get on the mainland.

Make the journey part of the experience. Twenty minutes outside Glasgow, after you pass Dumbarton, you're at Loch Lomond and from there you have two hours of some of the most beautiful scenery on earth, followed by a two-hour ferry journey to unwind.

We now live on Jura (a second ferry journey away!), but lived on Islay for a few years before that. We're very familiar with all the ins and outs of getting on and off the islands and dodging winter storms or summer rushes. We've been helping hundreds of guests make their trip successfully since we first let out our own home, Portbahn House, in 2017 — so if you have any questions or fears, do just get in touch.

**By Ferry from Kennacraig**

The Isle of Islay is accessible by CalMac ferry from Kennacraig on the Kintyre Peninsula to two ports — Port Ellen (2 hours 20 minutes) and Port Askaig (2 hours). Both ports are approximately 30-40 minutes' drive from our Bruichladdich properties. You have to book a ferry to a specific port rather than just to "Islay" — which port will depend on what time you're travelling. The crossing offers beautiful views across the Sound of Jura.

Vehicle reservations are absolutely essential and should be booked up to 12 weeks in advance, especially during peak season and Fèis Ìle (the whisky festival) in late May. We can't emphasise this enough. Book your ferry as soon as you book your accommodation if you can.

A really important note: if there isn't the exact crossing you want, book the closest you can — ferry bookings change daily and if you have enough time before you travel you'll almost certainly be able to change it. But get a reservation in the system!

**Which Port to Choose?**

Port Askaig is marginally closer to Bruichladdich (25 minutes vs 40 minutes from Port Ellen), but both routes work equally well and the choice of port will be dictated by the sailing times, so don't worry overly. Check which sailing times suit your schedule — Port Ellen and Port Askaig ferries operate on different timetables throughout the day.

**By Air from Glasgow**

Loganair operates daily flights from Glasgow to Islay Airport, with the flight taking approximately 25 minutes. Two flights typically operate daily (one on weekends), first thing in the morning and at around 5pm. Islay Airport is 30 minutes' drive from our properties. This option suits travellers preferring speed over scenery, though the ferry crossing itself is such a special part of the island experience.

While the ferries are disrupted by wind, it's low cloud that disrupts the flights. Islay Airport doesn't have the radar required to allow landing in poor visibility — the pilots must be able to see the runway clearly. A general rule of thumb: if you can see the other side of Loch Indaal, the plane can land. If you can't, it won't! This can mean some strategic planning — low cloud, get the ferry; high winds, take the plane. If you're not sure, get in touch and we'll help.

**What to Expect on the Crossing**

Arrive at Kennacraig ferry terminal at least 30-45 minutes before departure or you risk being placed in the standby queue — they are strict! Once you drive onto the ferry, leave your car and head upstairs to the passenger lounges — you cannot remain in your vehicle during the crossing. Pets are allowed aboard on the passenger deck.

Foot passengers, head to the main CalMac office or see one of the stewards who will point you towards the ramp onto the ferry.

The ferry has an excellent restaurant serving really good quality hot food, locally sourced wherever possible (including Jura's own Kirsty's pies!), along with basic snacks and drinks (including Islay whisky and gin of course). We always plan to have our main meal on the ferry home!

Most guests find the crossing relaxing rather than rough. If it's very rough they don't sail. On clear days, views of the Paps of Jura and the Kintyre coastline are spectacular — you pass by Gigha, and it's not uncommon to spot seals, occasionally dolphins, and you regularly see the giant Lion's Mane jellyfish from the deck. One guest recently said, *"The crossing was part of the holiday"* — something we hear quite often!

If you're prone to motion sickness, head out onto the deck and stare straight at the horizon — seems to work best! Or if you're inside, sit near the centre of the vessel on the lower passenger deck where movement and roll is minimised. Try to avoid reading or looking at screens — focus on the horizon instead, or close your eyes. The café sells basic remedies, but bring your own travel sickness pills (Stugeron, Kwells or Dramamine) if you want something stronger.

**Planning Your Journey**

Your journey to Islay typically represents a full travel day, so plan on that and enjoy it. From Glasgow, expect minimum 5-6 hours door-to-door via ferry (3 hours driving to Kennacraig + 2½-hour crossing + onward travel). Stop at Loch Lomond for a picnic, at Loch Fyne for seafood lunch (with an amazing garden centre and café next door!), or at historic Inveraray with its jail and castle.

We recommend treating your first and last days as travel days rather than packing in activities. A week-long stay gives you 5 genuine activity days. Our guests who book for 7+ nights consistently tell us they wish they'd had longer.

Travel to Islay is not straightforward — but that's part of the adventure. CalMac ferry from Kennacraig takes 2 hours to Port Askaig or 2 hours 20 minutes to Port Ellen. Loganair flies from Glasgow in 25 minutes. Book ferry vehicle spaces 12 weeks ahead — they fill fast, especially for Fèis Ìle. We've been helping hundreds of guests navigate the journey since 2017.

### Block 2: `ferry-support`

**Entity Type:** Trust/Service
**Canonical Home:** `/travel-to-islay`
**Teaser Used On:** Homepage, Property FAQs

#### Full Version

**Don't panic — here's the reality:** Because we live here, we know the ropes. We've helped dozens of guests navigate CalMac disruptions over the years. We hold a 5.0/5 communication rating on Airbnb, and 30+ reviews specifically mention our ferry crisis support! One guest wrote: *"Pi looked after us like family during the ferry chaos."* We've got you!

If your crossing is disrupted, you're not alone. But plan well ahead, watch the weather, get ferry alerts and stay in touch!

**Why Cancellations Occur**

Weather is the main culprit — wind gusts above 40-45mph can prevent safe boarding or crossing. CalMac also occasionally suspends sailings due to mechanical issues (the fleet is ageing) or industrial action. Winter months see more disruptions than summer, but cancellations can happen any time of year.

Be prepared: call ahead, keep an eye on the weather, and sign up for CalMac travel alerts.

**What to Do If Your Ferry is Cancelled**

1. **CalMac will contact you** via text or email if they cancel your sailing
2. **Call CalMac immediately** on 0800 066 5000 to rebook onto the next available sailing
3. **Contact me** — I can offer advice or flexible check-in arrangements and possibly additional accommodation if needed
4. **Sign up for live updates** by texting "calmac subscribe 09" to 60030 for ferry status alerts

**Flexible Tickets**

If you book "flexi" tickets (slightly more expensive than standard), you can change your sailing without penalty. This provides peace of mind if you're worried about disruption, particularly for winter bookings.

**Travel Insurance**

We very strongly recommend travel insurance that covers ferry cancellations. Weather disruptions are a part of island life. Check what your insurance protects regarding this and your accommodation costs if you cannot reach Islay on your planned dates. Most travel policies include "delayed departure" cover.

We cannot refund your accommodation costs if your ferry is disrupted or you miss it, unfortunately, so make sure you're properly covered!

**Our Commitment**

If ferry disruption affects your arrival or departure, contact me immediately. We can usually accommodate late arrivals or adjust check-out times, or even put you up at one of our other properties for an extra night. In 8+ years of hosting hundreds of guests, we've never had a booking completely collapse due to CalMac — there's always a solution, even if it means thinking outside the box!

### Block 4: `bruichladdich-proximity`

**Entity Type:** Location
**Canonical Home:** Homepage, Section 4 (Why We Love Bruichladdich)
**Teaser Used On:** Property pages, Explore Islay

#### Full Version

The village of Bruichladdich, dominated by its progressive whisky distillery, sits on the western shore of Loch Indaal on the Rhinns of Islay, a fifteen-minute drive from Islay's main centre of Bowmore.

The Rhinns has a character all of its own and is geologically completely different to the rest of Islay — part of the land mass connected to South America, comprised primarily of incredibly ancient gneiss rock, with a fault line running the centre of Loch Indaal through Loch Gruinart. Earthquakes are frequent, though rarely felt!

We love this part of Islay, from Bridgend Woods, down through the pretty harbour villages of Port Charlotte and Portnahaven at the tip, to the dramatic west coast beaches and rock formations at Machir Bay, Saligo and Sanaigmore.

The village is a great base to explore everything the island offers. You're a scenic 5-minute walk to Bruichladdich Distillery along the coastal cycle path — tour the distillery, sample world-renowned, record-breaking single malts and, of course, The Botanist gin, then walk home.

The coastal location of our houses gives immediate access to Portbahn Beach just down from the war memorial — one of Islay's hidden gems with three sheltered bays perfect for wild swimming, rock pooling, and coastal ambling.

It's also just a 5-minute drive or 40-minute walk from Port Charlotte village, perhaps Islay's prettiest, with two outstanding pubs/hotels with excellent local food and extensive whisky selections — The Port Charlotte Hotel and Lochindaal. There's also the fascinating Islay Museum about the history of the island, a local shop, post office and petrol station, and the children's playground at Port Mor.

**From Here, Everything's Reachable**

From Bruichladdich, all ten of Islay's whisky distilleries are within easy reach. The island's renowned beaches — Machir Bay to Saligo Bay to the dunes at Ardnave Point — offer miles of golden sand and dramatic Atlantic surf. RSPB nature reserves at Loch Gruinart provide exceptional bird watching, with over 30,000 barnacle geese arriving each winter from Greenland. The countryside is perfect for hiking and wildlife spotting, from golden eagles to seals.

Bruichladdich's central west coast location on the Rhinns makes it an ideal base for experiencing the very best of island life on Islay — but from a different angle than the ferry ports.

---

#### Teaser Version

You're a 5-minute walk from the pioneering Bruichladdich Distillery along the coastal cycle path — tour the distillery, then walk home. Portbahn Beach is 5 minutes the other way. Port Charlotte village (restaurants, shops, museum, and petrol) is a 5-minute drive. Bruichladdich's central location means all ten distilleries and Islay's best beaches are within easy reach.

### Block 5: `portbahn-beach`

**Entity Type:** Place
**Canonical Home:** Explore Islay, Section 3 (Beaches)
**Teaser Used On:** Homepage, Property pages

#### Full Version

Portbahn Beach is our hidden gem — literally 5 minutes from our door via the war memorial path. It's three small, sheltered bays tucked into the coastline with stunning views across Loch Indaal. Safe for swimming, perfect for rock pooling with kids, and you'll almost always have it entirely to yourselves.

There's rarely any tidal flow in Loch Indaal, making it very safe, but still plenty of rock pools and places to go crabbing. The water around Islay is cold (10-14°C typical), but it's sheltered enough for a quick dip if you're brave. One guest wrote: *"Better than the pictures — we had breakfast on Portbahn Beach every morning and saw seals."*

This is genuinely one of Islay's best kept secrets, and it's our local spot — so pretty much yours to explore at will from the moment you arrive!

#### Teaser Version

Portbahn Beach is 5 minutes' walk via the war memorial path — three tiny sheltered coves, safe swimming, rock pools at low tide, and you'll usually have it entirely to yourselves.

### Block 6: `shorefield-character`

**Entity Type:** Property
**Canonical Home:** Shorefield property page
**Teaser Used On:** Homepage, Explore Islay

#### Full Version

Shorefield is the Jackson family's old family home — their personality is everywhere, and we're privileged to look after it for them. They built this eco-house to include wind and solar power well before it was popular, planted every tree on the property, created the wetlands and bird hides, and filled the house over the years with paintings, books, and curios from their travels around the world.

It's quirky, full of personality, well worn and well loved over years of family use. This isn't a styled rental; it's a real family home. If you prefer bright, modern open-plan simplicity, Portbahn House would probably suit you better. But if you value character, cosiness, and a house that feels like *"a big hug"* (as one guest said!), Shorefield really does make a wonderful stay. We love spending time here ourselves in the winter gardening and looking after the place.

The house is stocked with binoculars, bird books, and wildlife guides from the Jacksons' collection, along with their own sketches and watercolours. The garden, woods behind the house and wetland ponds attract plentiful birds, and the loch views offer opportunities to watch waterfowl and sea birds without leaving the property.

Over 90% of guests have told us they genuinely love the quirky charm and personal touches — it's what makes Shorefield special!

**Woodlands, Wetlands and Bird Hides**

Shorefield has something unique: woodlands, wetland ponds and bird hides created by the Jackson family, who were passionate birders. They planted the trees, created the wetlands, and built the hides specifically for wildlife watching. Even if bird watching isn't your thing, kids love getting lost in the woods behind the house, playing hide and seek, making dens and creating adventures.

If you're a birder or nature lover, Shorefield offers something you won't find at a typical holiday rental — it's a family home built around a love of wildlife and nature.

### Block 7: `port-charlotte-village`

**Entity Type:** Place
**Canonical Home:** Homepage, Section 4
**Teaser Used On:** Property pages

#### Full Version

Port Charlotte is perhaps Islay's prettiest village, just a 5-minute drive or 40-minute walk along the coastal path from our properties. It's the social hub of the Rhinns, with regular live music at the Port Charlotte Hotel and immense local seafood platters at the Lochindaal — it has everything you'll need for a self-catering break.

**Where to Eat & Drink**

**Port Charlotte Hotel** — Owned and run by Grahame and Isabelle, with Scottish fare and an outstanding whisky bar with 300+ bottles on their single malt menu. The restaurant takes bookings (advised), but the bar is walk-in. Good Sunday roasts. Traditional Scottish live music on Wednesdays and Sundays is popular and a lovely way to spend an evening by a roaring log fire, dram in hand.

**Lochindaal Seafood Kitchen** — Truly exceptional, run with huge heart by Jack and his father Iain. An absolute highlight (we'd say a MUST), the seafood platters from the local fishermen's catch feature oysters, langoustines, crab, lobster and mussels. You need to order the full platter 24 hours ahead and it may vary depending on catch — but it is absolutely worth planning around. Also a great whisky selection if you just want to drop in for a pint or a dram. Our guests consistently rave about this place and it's one of our favourite spots on the Rhinns.

**What Else You'll Find**

The fascinating Islay Museum tells the history of the island. There's a local shop, post office and petrol station for essentials. For families, the children's playground at Port Mor has sea views and is a favourite with our kids and our guests' children. There's also a good café serving great comfort food.

---

#### Teaser Version

Port Charlotte village is a 5-minute drive — perhaps Islay's prettiest, with the Port Charlotte Hotel (300+ whiskies, live music Wed & Sun), Lochindaal Seafood Kitchen (order the platter 24h ahead), Islay Museum, local shop, and the Port Mor playground for families.

### Block 8: `distilleries-overview`

**Entity Type:** Activity
**Canonical Home:** Explore Islay, Section 2
**Teaser Used On:** Homepage, Property FAQs

#### Full Version

Having lived and worked on Islay for a number of years, we know the island well and want to share our take on the whisky scene. Islay currently has ten working whisky distilleries, and you're just a 5-minute walk from one of the world's best and certainly most innovative — and the reason we came to the islands — Bruichladdich.

Islay produces some of the world's most celebrated single malts and people come here from all over the world, almost as a pilgrimage, particularly for the intensely peated, smoky whiskies that are synonymous with Islay's maritime character. Many visitors plan entire trips around distillery tours and tastings — we've hosted whisky groups dozens of times, and we're always happy to help you plan your distillery days.

**The Ten Islay Distilleries**

1. **Ardbeg** — Intensely peated, cult following, stunning coastal location, wonderful café
2. **Lagavulin** — Classic Islay style, 16-year flagship, accessible from Port Ellen
3. **Laphroaig** — Medicinal, iodine notes, right on the shore — love it or hate it!
4. **Bowmore** — Claims to be Islay's oldest (1779), balanced peat, town centre location
5. **Bruichladdich** — Innovative and radical; world's most heavily peated as well as unpeated expressions + The Botanist gin, **5-minute walk from our properties**
6. **Kilchoman** — Farm distillery, barley to bottle on-site, very visitor-friendly, great café for lunch
7. **Bunnahabhain** — Gentle, mostly unpeated, remote northern location with stunning views of the Paps of Jura
8. **Caol Ila** — Largest Islay producer, used in Johnnie Walker, Port Askaig, dramatic setting
9. **Ardnahoe** — Recent (opened 2018), Port Askaig, new releases, still maturing their stock, great café
10. **Port Ellen** — Newest (closed 1983, reopened 2024), Port Ellen, limited releases of old stock, maturing new

**Our Recommendation: Start at Bruichladdich**

Tour Bruichladdich first — it's our nearest distillery, an easy 5-minute walk along the coastal path and it really is genuinely unique.

Self-styled Progressive Hebridean Distillers, Bruichladdich are one of the most creative whisky distillers in Scotland, driving the importance of terroir and provenance throughout all their single malts. They release very limited editions of single farm, single vintage and single barley varieties each year in their Islay Barley and Bere Barley ranges. They're also quite special in that their malts range from the unpeated Laddie Classic, through the more traditionally Islay heavily-peated Port Charlotte, to the world's peatiest whisky, the highly exclusive Octomore range.

For gin lovers, the distillery is also home to the world-class, award-winning Botanist Gin. There's genuinely something for everybody at Bruichladdich, which is why it makes such a good first visit.

The distillery tours and whisky tastings, particularly the warehouse experience, are truly excellent — personal and a fascinating insight into the pedigree of whisky in quite a different way.

As a bonus, you can walk home afterward without worrying about driving. We recommend this to every guest, and the feedback is always very positive. It really is the one place we'd urge you to go if you're only visiting one distillery.

From there, plan your distillery days based on your whisky preferences. Heavily peated? Focus on the short stretch of southern coast that contains Ardbeg, Lagavulin, and Laphroaig (the south coast "killers"). A bit softer with more balance? Bowmore. Small and traditional? Head for Kilchoman and have lunch at the café. For something gentler, Bunnahabhain produces beautiful unpeated malts. And if you want to see whisky production at scale and with technology, head for Caol Ila or Ardnahoe.

**How Many Distilleries Per Day?**

Two per day is comfortable. Three can become rushed and overwhelming. It also depends where you're heading.

It makes sense to visit Ardbeg, Laphroaig and Lagavulin as a trio since they're so close, perhaps along with the recently reopened Port Ellen. Ardbeg has a great café so you can break the day with lunch there.

On the north coast, Caol Ila, Bunnahabhain and Ardnahoe sit along the Sound of Islay facing the Paps of Jura and make another good cluster, with good food and drinks at the Ardnahoe visitor centre.

Something to remember: factor in travel time between distilleries (some are 45+ minutes apart), and remember that tastings accumulate quickly. Pace yourself and actually enjoy the experience rather than ticking boxes.

Our whisky groups typically tour 5-6 distilleries over 3-4 full days, with beach walks and meals in between. That rhythm seems to work really well.

And make sure you leave time for Islay's other attractions — most importantly, the pace of life!

**Booking Distillery Tours**

Book tours in advance — essential for summer dates and absolutely critical for Fèis Ìle (the whisky festival in late May). Most distilleries limit tour sizes and fill up weeks ahead. Tours typically run 10am-4pm with limited afternoon slots. Check individual distillery websites for availability and prices.

Most distilleries offer standard tours (45-60 minutes, £10-15) plus premium experiences with warehouse tastings or rare drams (£40-80+). If you're serious about whisky, the premium tours are worth it.

**Drinking and Driving**

Scotland's drink-drive limit is effectively zero — take this seriously. Distilleries provide "driver's drams" — takeaway miniatures for designated drivers to enjoy later at your accommodation. This system works well. Let them know who's driving when you arrive for a tasting and they'll usually help you out.

Alternatively, hire a guide or taxi for distillery days. We can recommend local drivers who specialise in distillery tours if you'd prefer not to worry about limits.

### Block 9: `wildlife-geese`

**Entity Type:** Nature
**Canonical Home:** Explore Islay, Section 4
**Teaser Used On:** Homepage

#### Full Version

Islay is exceptional for wildlife and particularly known for its birdwatching. Although you can spot a huge array of bird life all year round, timing can be everything!

**Barnacle Geese**

Over 30,000 barnacle geese arrive from Greenland each October, spending winter on Islay before returning north in April. RSPB Loch Gruinart reserve is the best viewing location — the morning flights as thousands of geese lift from the loch are spectacular. The sound is unforgettable.

If you're visiting between October and April, witnessing the geese is a highlight. Arrive at Loch Gruinart at dawn for the best show. Guests who've experienced this consistently describe it as one of their trip highlights. The local farmers, however, are a bit less enthusiastic — they can decimate crops!

**Eagles**

Islay has both golden eagles and white-tailed sea eagles — two of Scotland's most magnificent raptors. Keep an eye out for them over moorland, coastal cliffs, and inland hills. Sea eagles are enormous with wingspans up to 8 feet. If you see something huge gliding overhead, it's likely a sea eagle. A good check is "does it look like a barn door?" — their square-ended wing profile is quite distinctive.

We keep binoculars in all our properties, and guests regularly spot eagles from the houses or during coastal walks.

**Seals, Otters & Marine Life**

Common seals and grey seals frequent Loch Indaal and coastal areas. Guests spot seals from our property windows regularly — sometimes they're visible from the breakfast table at Portbahn House. Otters are shyer but present along quiet shorelines. Your best chance is early morning or dusk along the coast. Meandering along the stretch of coast that runs alongside the Bruichladdich–Port Charlotte cycle path is a lovely way to wildlife spot.

Dolphins and porpoises also occasionally visit Loch Indaal. We've had guests see them from Portbahn House and Shorefield's windows — it's rare but magical when it happens. Minke whales and basking sharks can sometimes be seen offshore in summer months.

**RSPB Reserves**

- **RSPB Loch Gruinart** — Flagship reserve for geese, waders, raptors. Also has a nature trail and woods to explore.
- **RSPB The Oa** — Cliffs, choughs, seabirds, dramatic coastal scenery.

Both reserves are free to visit with hides, trails, and visitor information. Bring binoculars (essential for birding), a camera with zoom lens, and warm layers for dawn/dusk watching.

### Block 10: `food-drink-islay`

**Entity Type:** Activity
**Canonical Home:** Explore Islay, Section 5
**Teaser Used On:** Homepage

#### Full Version

Islay's food scene emphasises local seafood, lamb, venison and whisky. Dining out generally isn't cheap, but quality is high. Most guests cook meals in our well-equipped kitchens as well and eat out selectively. Here's where we recommend:

**Our Top Recommendations**

**Lochindaal Seafood Kitchen, Port Charlotte**
This is truly exceptional, run with huge heart by Jack and his father Iain — seafood platters from the local fishermen's catch, featuring local oysters, langoustines, crab, and mussels among others. You do need to order the full platter 24 hours ahead, but it's really worth planning around. Small, cosy venue in Port Charlotte with two bars. Book ahead — it fills fast. Our guests consistently rave about this place. Also a great whisky selection if you just want to drop in for a pint or a dram.

**Port Charlotte Hotel**
Scottish fare and an outstanding whisky bar with 300+ bottles on their single malt menu. The restaurant takes bookings (advised), but the bar is walk-in. Good Sunday roasts. Traditional Scottish live music on Wednesdays and Sundays is popular and a lovely way to spend an evening by a roaring log fire, dram in hand. We send guests here regularly, and they're never disappointed.

**An Tigh Seinnse, Portnahaven**
Traditional little village pub at the end of the Rhinns, with home-cooked food and local charm in possibly Islay's most remote coastal village. Small, authentic, popular with locals and visitors. Book ahead — it's worth the 20-minute drive from Bruichladdich. You can nearly always spot seals in Portnahaven harbour, just outside the pub.

**Food and Drink in Bowmore**

- **Peatzeria, Bowmore** — Creative wood-fired pizzas with Islay twists — toppings include local lobster, scallops, and whisky-infused sauces. Casual, family-friendly, good for a relaxed dinner.
- **The Cottage, Bowmore** — Burgers, fries, jacket potatoes, and good comfort grub.
- **Islay's Plaice, Bowmore** — Fresh fish and chips cooked perfectly by Andy and Islay!
- **Bowmore town centre** — Chinese and Indian takeaways, bakery, butcher. Useful for stocking up or grabbing quick meals when you don't want to cook or book ahead.

**Food and Drink in Port Ellen**

- **The Copper Still, Port Ellen** — Amazing home-roasted coffee, handmade deli sandwiches, cakes, soup and the best brownies on the planet; run with love by Mari and Joe; by the ferry terminal.
- **SeaSalt Bistro, Port Ellen** — Pizza, pasta, seafood and steaks on the Port Ellen waterfront.

**Distillery Cafés**
- **Ardbeg** (great café, excellent lunch stop)
- **Ardnahoe** (visitor centre with food & drinks)
- **Kilchoman** (café at the farm distillery)

**Groceries & Self-Catering**

**Aileen's Mini-Market, Bruichladdich** (5-minute walk from our properties)
Coffee, bacon rolls, newspapers, basic groceries, post office. We love Aileen and our guests absolutely rave about this place — start your morning here with a coffee and bacon roll, particularly after a heavy day of distillery tours! Aileen's (known locally as Debbie's!) is a Bruichladdich institution.

**Co-op, Bowmore** (15-minute drive)
The biggest "supermarket" on Islay — small but sufficient, with fresh produce, meat, alcohol, household supplies. This is your main grocery stop for stocking the kitchen.

**Co-op, Port Ellen** (45-minute drive)
Another smaller Co-op supermarket on the seafront at Port Ellen stocking essentials.

**Port Charlotte Stores** (5-minute drive from our properties)
All-round basic shop, post office and petrol pump for essentials.

**Jean's Fresh Fish Van**
Visits villages weekly — check local schedules. Fresh local fish and seafood delivered to your door essentially.

**Dining In**
Most guests tend to cook several meals during their stay. Our kitchens are fully equipped with everything you need if that's your preference. Dining out every night adds up quickly on Islay — expect £40-60 per person for dinner with drinks.

### Block 11: `beaches-overview`

**Entity Type:** Place
**Canonical Home:** Explore Islay, Section 3 (expanded)
**Teaser Used On:** Homepage

#### Full Version

Islay's coastline is peppered with dozens of beaches, some sheltered, some ferocious — and you'll often have miles of sand entirely to yourselves. These are some of our favourites and the ones guests ask about most:

**Safe Swimming Beaches**

- **Portbahn Beach** — Our hidden gem, 5-minute walk, 3 tiny sheltered coves, safe swimming, rock pools at low tide
- **Port Charlotte Beach** — 5-minute drive, family-friendly, shallow, sandy, ice cream in the village after
- **Laggan Bay / Airport Beach** — Long, shallow, sandy, safe for swimming
- **Kilnaughton Bay** — Near Port Ellen, family-friendly, shallow, safe

**Dramatic Atlantic Beaches (NOT safe for swimming)**

- **Machir Bay** — Islay's most famous, 2 miles of golden sand backed by dunes, dramatic Atlantic surf and stunning sunsets. Head northwards up the coast towards Opera House Rocks for expansive skies, crashing waves and eagles for company. Or head south and walk over the top to the old ruined chapel at Kilchiaran. Spectacular for walks — but DANGEROUS currents.
- **Saligo Bay** — Dramatic Atlantic, stunning but NOT safe for swimming
- **Sanaigmore** — Dramatic stretch of northern coast with great rock formations for playing hide and seek. There's also a lovely small art gallery nearby serving coffee and cakes.
- **Ardnave Point** — Rolling dunes perfect for kids running full pelt, big skies and empty beaches. Combine with a roam through the nature trail and woods at nearby RSPB Loch Gruinart.

**Hidden Gems**

- **Singing Sands** — Beautiful remote beach worth the walk. The sand squeaks underfoot — kids love it.
- **Claggain Bay** — Secluded, with a lovely coastal walk to reach it. Rarely visited.
- **Port Ellen town beach** — Convenient if you're arriving by the southern ferry or combining with a south coast distillery day.

**CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING:** Machir Bay, Saligo Bay, and Sanaigmore are **not safe for swimming**. Strong currents, undertows, and cold Atlantic conditions make these "drowning beaches" as locals call them. There have been a number of close calls over the years. Admire them, walk them, photograph them — but don't enter the water. And remember, the RNLI and coastguard who'll come to rescue you are volunteers!

For actual swimming, stick to Loch Indaal beaches (Portbahn, Port Charlotte) or the southeast coast (Laggan Bay, Kilnaughton). Either embrace the cold water (it really is good for you — we love it!), or bring a wetsuit if you're planning any proper open water swimming. The water is cold year-round (10-14°C), and wetsuits make wild swimming more comfortable for longer splashing about.

### Block 12: `families-children`

**Entity Type:** Activity
**Canonical Home:** Explore Islay (Section 6)
**Teaser Used On:** Homepage, Property pages

#### Full Version

Islay is a wonderful holiday for families. Like winding the clock back fifty years if you want to. Safe beaches for rock pooling, wildlife on your doorstep, playgrounds in most of the villages, and just enough activities to fill the days without overscheduling. Children thrive here because they have space to roam, explore, and get properly muddy. And happy children equals happy families!

We've hosted dozens of families in our houses over the years, and we've raised our two children here on both islands — so we know what a special place this is for kids. We know the beaches they love, the rainy day escapes, and the wildlife moments that stick with them. These are the things we do with our own children, rain or sun.

**Safe Beaches for Kids**

Portbahn Beach is our hidden gem — a 5-minute walk from our properties via the war memorial path. Three sheltered bays with rock pools at low tide, safe for paddling, and you'll usually have it entirely to yourselves. Our kids have spent countless hours here collecting shells, watching crabs, and building dams in the rock pools. It's our go-to spot.

Port Charlotte Beach is a 5-minute drive — shallow, sandy, with easy parking and the village right there for ice cream after.

On the southeast coast, Laggan Bay and Kilnaughton Bay (near Port Ellen) offer miles of shallow, sandy shoreline perfect for building sandcastles and safe wading.

Sanaigmore is a dramatic stretch of northern coast with great rock formations for playing hide and seek — our two love it here. There's also a lovely small art gallery nearby serving coffee and cakes for the grown-ups!

Ardnave Point is another favourite — rolling dunes perfect for kids running full pelt, with big skies and empty beaches. Combine it with a roam through the nature trail and woods at nearby RSPB Loch Gruinart for a proper adventure day.

**IMPORTANT:** The big Atlantic beaches (Machir Bay, Saligo Bay) are stunning for walks but **not safe for swimming** — strong currents and undertows. We take our children there for dramatic coastal walks, but stick to the sheltered and shallow Loch Indaal beaches for actual paddling.

**Rainy Day Activities**

When the weather turns (and it will, hourly! — this is Scotland!), we'll often head for the Mactaggart Leisure Centre in Bowmore. The indoor swimming pool is a great place to hang out on wet days and has saved many a holiday. Check their Facebook page — they often have giant inflatables in the school holidays.

Persabus Pottery is run with love by the wonderful Rosemary, and it's another of our family favourites — for kids and grown-ups alike. Our house has plenty of treasured mugs and bowls painted by our children over the years, as do their grandparents' homes! It's a creative activity that keeps everyone engaged for a couple of hours while the rain lashes down outside.

Older children find the Islay Woollen Mill interesting, with its working looms and the story of island tweed. They produce tweeds for some of the top design houses in the world — do ask them about it!

Honestly, some of our best family days have been wet ones — board games by the fire, hot chocolate, and watching the weather roll across Loch Indaal from the window. Island kids learn to embrace it. There's no such thing as bad weather!

**Wildlife Adventures**

This is where Islay really makes memories for families. Rock pooling at Portbahn Beach at low tide reveals crabs, sea anemones, whelks and tiny fish — our kids always got excited about this while we were living at Portbahn House. Walk the coastal paths and you'll spot seals bobbing in the water — Portnahaven harbour is almost guaranteed. Between October and April, the barnacle geese at Loch Gruinart are unforgettable — 30,000+ birds lifting off at dawn, honking. We take our children every autumn and it never gets old. Eagles circle overhead year-round if you keep looking up.

**Family-Friendly Eating**

The distillery cafés are surprisingly family-friendly — Ardbeg has excellent food and welcomes children, as do Kilchoman and Ardnahoe. Peatzeria in Bowmore does creative wood-fired pizzas in a casual setting that works well with kids — who doesn't love a pizza?! In Bowmore you'll also find The Cottage for burgers, fries, jacket potatoes, and Islay's Plaice for fresh fish and chips that kids and adults alike will devour.

And if you just want to stay in and cook your old home favourites, all our houses have well-equipped kitchens — it's more relaxed, cheaper, and kids eat what they actually want. Hopefully!

**Our Properties for Families**

- **Portbahn House** has a sunken trampoline and swings in a secure garden — kids can play while you watch from the kitchen. It sleeps 8, so there's space for everyone.
- **Curlew Cottage** is set back from the road surrounded by farmland and has a fully enclosed walled patio garden — ideal for younger children who want to run around safely. Cosy inside, peaceful outside.
- **Shorefield** appeals to older children who'll appreciate the bird hides and wildlife watching from the windows — grab the binoculars and see what you can spot. Even if bird watching isn't their thing, kids can get lost in the woods behind the house, playing hide and seek or making dens and creating adventures.

One guest told us, *"The kids didn't want screens all week — they were too busy with the beach, the trampoline, and counting seals."* That's exactly the kind of holiday Islay offers — and it's the childhood our own kids have had here.

### Block 13: `jura-day-trip`

**Entity Type:** Activity
**Canonical Home:** Jura page
**Teaser Used On:** Explore Islay, Getting Here

#### Full Version

A short 5-minute ferry from Port Askaig connects Islay to the neighbouring Isle of Jura, although it genuinely feels like a world away. Alongside its whisky, the island is perhaps most notable as the place Orwell wrote *1984* and the K Foundation burned a million pounds. While Islay has a gentle borders/lowland feel, Jura is all Highland. It makes a perfect day trip to see the dramatic Paps of Jura mountains, visit Jura Distillery, have lunch at the Antlers or Jura Hotel, hire bikes and walk or cycle around Small Isles Bay to Corran Sands. Or for a real treat, drive up to Ardlussa, sample some Lussa Gin and admire the stunning coastal scenery.

**Getting There**

The small car ferry runs roughly every hour from Port Askaig. No booking needed for foot passengers — just turn up at least 10 minutes before scheduled departure. Short queue for cars, but check the timetable for last ferry times and travel alerts — the weather and tides affect sailings.

**A Perfect Day Trip**

1. **Morning ferry** from Port Askaig (5 minutes)
2. **Jura Distillery tour** — Book ahead for tours, or drop in for a dram
3. **Lunch** at the Antlers (homebaked deli food, friendly atmosphere) or Jura Hotel (restaurant dining and pub grub)
4. **Afternoon** — Hire bikes and cycle to Small Isles Bay / Corran Sands, or walk the coastal path; pop into the church and photographs of old Jura life round the back
5. **Wildlife** — Red deer everywhere, often on the roadside; eagles and sea otters are frequently seen
6. **Views** — The Paps of Jura dominate every vista
7. **Return ferry** — Check timetable for last sailing. Book the late 2130 ferry 24 hours in advance if you really want a full day and evening meal.

Or, drive straight to Ardlussa in the north, visit the wonderful girls at award-winning locally made Lussa Gin and slowly meander back, taking in Jura's dramatic coastline and bays.

**Tips**

- Bikes can be hired on Jura — a lovely way to explore
- Do head north to Ardlussa — the drive is absolutely stunning and unlike anything on Islay
- The single-track road is quiet, but watch for deer and remember the passing places!
- Mobile signal is pretty good — EE and Vodafone are most reliable, others patchy
- The pace is even slower than Islay — embrace it

With one road, one whisky distillery, one gin distillery, one pub, and more deer than people (6,000+ red deer to ~250 residents), Jura is Islay's wilder, quieter neighbour. We moved across in 2017 and absolutely love it here.

### Block 14: `jura-longer-stay`

**Entity Type:** Activity
**Canonical Home:** Jura page
**Teaser Used On:** —

#### Full Version

For those wanting to explore Jura properly (and we really do recommend it!), a longer stay gives you so much more, with experiences you simply can't fit into a day:

**Barnhill & George Orwell**

At the remote northern tip of Jura, Barnhill is where George Orwell wrote *1984* in 1946-48. The house still stands (a private house still owned by the Fletcher family — please do respect their privacy), and the journey to reach it — 25 miles of single-track road, the last 4 miles a rough track that must be walked — is an adventure in itself. For literary pilgrims it's a great excuse to head north.

**Corryvreckan Whirlpool**

The third largest whirlpool in the world churns between Jura and Scarba. Visible from the northern tip of Jura, it's most dramatic at certain tides. Orwell nearly drowned here in 1947 — nearly losing the manuscript of *1984* in the process. Boat trips from Robert at Jura Boat Tours will take you right up close and are a dramatic way to experience the island and regularly spot eagles and dolphins.

**Climb a Pap**

The three Paps of Jura (Beinn an Oir is the highest at 785m) are serious hill walks — not technical climbing, but hard going with no paths and often a scramble over bog and rock. They are steep and remote. But a clear day rewards you with views to Ireland, Mull, and the mainland. Not for novices, but achievable for fit hikers. Leave a full day and let someone know the route you are taking.

**Jura's West Coast**

Jura's Atlantic west coast is one of Britain's wildest landscapes — raised beaches, caves, no roads, no people. Walking it requires planning and fitness, but it's genuinely remote in a way few places in Britain can match. It takes about a week to do tip to tip. If you want a taste of the west coast, it can be accessed at Tarbert in the middle of Jura, down a track leading from the main road to the head of Loch Tarbert, the huge bite out of Jura's west coast. There is also a track that heads north from Feolin past Inver Estate lodge that gives easy access to the west coast in about an hour or so's walking.

**K Foundation Burn A Million Pounds**

For pop culture pilgrims: the boathouse where the KLF's Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty burned £1 million in 1994 is on Jura's Ardfin Estate, now a private golf course (the irony!). Scotland's Right to Roam laws do allow access, but be sensitive.

**Wildlife**

Red deer are everywhere — you'll see dozens daily. Eagles soar over the Paps. Seals and otters inhabit the coastline and are regularly seen around Small Isles Bay.

**The Pace**

Even slower than Islay. One shop, one hotel, one pub, two distilleries. If you want true escape, this is it.

Consider combining a few days on Jura with your Islay stay — we have accommodation with hot tubs and saunas at Bothan Jura Retreat and can help you plan a multi-island trip.

#### Full Version

We also own and manage Bothan Jura Retreat on Jura — a passion project we built from scratch from an acre of bog and an old ruined cottage. We created it as the kind of place we'd want to escape to ourselves.

**The Accommodation**

- **Mrs Leonard's Cottage** — Old stone renovated cotters' cottage, sleeps 2. The original cottage that has sat here for over a century, braced against the Hebridean squalls and winters, now restored to snug comfort.
- **The Rusty Hut Lodge** — Cosy corten steel and timber, sleeps 2. Clad in beautiful rusted Corten steel like the old farm buildings around Knockrome; the old boards from Southport Pier line one wall, with oak floorboards on the floor.
- **The Black Hut Cabin** — Contemporary minimalist space, sleeps 2. Birch plywood simplicity with a handmade kitchen by our Welsh joiner Shaun.
- **The Shepherd's Hut** — Off-grid glamping, sleeps 2.

Each unit is designed for couples or solo travellers seeking genuine remoteness and has its own wood-fired hot tub. Mrs Leonard's Cottage also has a sauna.

**The Experience**

- **Hot tub** under the stars at the foot of the Paps
- **Sauna** to warm up after wild swimming or hill walking
- **Fire pit** for evening relaxation
- **Location** — Dramatic landscape, red deer wandering past, the Paps towering above, Corran Sands at the bottom of the drive

**Character**

We've built Bothan Jura Retreat over eight years with a lot of love and time and passion. We live here too. These are places we'd want to stay.

If you want wilderness and enjoy attention to detail — cosy but wild — you'll probably love it here. We've tried to make this place a part of ourselves: simple, beautiful, contemporary accommodation in one of Scotland's most remote landscapes.

**Getting There**

To get to Jura takes two ferries from the mainland (first to Islay, then to Jura), or fly to Islay then ferry. The journey is absolutely part of the experience and that final 5-minute leg on the wee ferry always feels special.

From March to the end of September the Jura Passenger Ferry also runs twice daily directly between Tayvallich on the mainland and Craighouse on Jura.

If Islay fills up or you're looking for even more remoteness, or an experience of two very different islands, consider splitting your trip between both islands. Get in touch and we'll help you create an Islay-Jura multi-island trip.

**Teaser Used On:** — (full content only)

#### Full Version

We're Pi and Lynton, and we've been welcoming guests to Islay since 2017. We started by letting out our own family home, Portbahn House, and now manage three properties in Bruichladdich — each one with its own story and character.

Portbahn House was our family home for years. Our books are still on the shelves, our children's games still in the cupboards. Shorefield is the Jacksons' creation — they built it with love, planted every tree, created the bird hides, and filled it with their art, books and curios from their travels. Curlew Cottage is our friend Alan's family holiday getaway, now opening to guests for the first time.

These aren't purpose-built holiday lets — they're real family homes with personality. We manage them the way we'd want our own homes looked after: with care, attention, and a genuine interest in making your stay really memorable.

We now live on Jura (one more ferry away!), where we built Bothan Jura Retreat from scratch — the kind of place we'd want to escape to ourselves. A hot tub in each space at the foot of the Paps, under the stars.

We've raised our two children here on the islands, so we know what a special place this is for families. We know the beaches, the walks, the rainy day escapes, the wildlife moments that stick with you. We love to share all of it.

We try to create the sort of places we like to stay when we go away — a genuine home from home. That's always been our philosophy, and guests tell us it comes through in the way we manage our properties and communicate throughout the booking process and help with any problems.

If you have any questions about Islay, Jura, our properties, or anything else — just get in touch. We love helping guests plan their trips.

Pi, Lynton and Amba

## Implementation Notes

### Sanity Schema Requirements

```javascript
{
  _type: 'canonicalBlock',
  blockId: 'string',       // e.g., 'ferry-basics'
  entityType: 'string',    // e.g., 'Travel'
  canonicalHome: 'string', // Page slug, e.g., '/travel-to-islay'
  fullContent: 'portableText',
  teaserContent: 'portableText',
  keyFacts: [{
    fact: 'string',
    value: 'string'
  }]
}
```

### Page References

```javascript
{
  _type: 'blockReference',
  block: reference,        // → canonicalBlock
  renderAs: 'full' | 'teaser'
}
```

### Critical Route Note

`ferry-basics` canonical home is `/travel-to-islay` — not `/getting-here`. Do not change this. The Sanity page document for the ferry/travel content lives at `/travel-to-islay`.

### Content Updates

When updating a block:
1. Edit this file only
2. Re-run `scripts/import-canonical-blocks.ts` to push changes to Sanity via `createOrReplace`
3. All pages using that block update automatically
4. Key Facts table ensures consistency across all block versions
