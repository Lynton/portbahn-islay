## Portbahn House — Universal Logistics Hub (5 Questions)

### Question 1: Can we check in early or have late checkout?

Standard times are 4pm check-in and 10am checkout, but contact me about your ferry or flight times — I'm flexible when the property schedule allows. I can almost always accommodate bag drop-off before check-in or storage after checkout.

---

### Question 2: Can you provide synthetic bedding for allergies?

Yes, no problem — just let me know about allergies when you book and I'll do my best to ensure you have synthetic pillows and duvets for the bedrooms you need. This is a common request and is usually easy to accommodate at any of our properties as most of them use synthetic materials as standard.

---

### Question 3: Is there parking at Portbahn House?

Yes — there's off-street parking in the drive of all our properties for 2-3 cars.

---

### Question 4: How many bedrooms does Portbahn House have?

Portbahn House has 3 bedrooms sleeping 8 guests across the ground floor:
- **Master bedroom** with ensuite: Superking + single bed (sleeps 3)
- **Triple bedroom:** Double + single bed (sleeps 3)
- **Twin bedroom:** Two single beds (sleeps 2)

All bedrooms and both bathrooms are ground floor with no stairs, making the property easily accessible for guests with mobility concerns.

---

### Question 5: Which distillery should we visit first?

Start with Bruichladdich — it's a 5-minute walk from Portbahn House (and our other properties) along the coastal path and is exceptional with an innovative approach to terroir and whisky making that sets it apart. You can tour the distillery, visit the warehouses and sample The Botanist gin, then walk home without worrying about driving.

From there, choose based on your whisky preferences: heavily peated and smoky (Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroaig on the south coast), balanced peat (Bowmore, Kilchoman), or gentle/unpeated (Bunnahabhain in the north).

## Shorefield — Character & Eco Features (5 Questions)

### Question 1: What makes Shorefield different from the other properties?

Shorefield is the Jackson family's creation — they built this eco-house powered by wind and solar, planted every tree on the property, created the wetlands and bird hides, and filled the house with paintings, books, and curios from their travels around the world.

It's quirky, full of personality, and a bit tired in places — carpets need refreshing and furniture has been well-loved. This isn't a styled rental; it's a real family home. If you prefer bright, modern open-plan simplicity, Portbahn House would suit you well. But if you value character, cosiness, and a house that feels like *"a big hug"* (as one guest said), Shorefield would make a wonderful stay.

---

### Question 2: Does Shorefield have a dishwasher?

No — no dishwasher, but there is a washing machine and dryer available, so laundry is covered. Most guests say it wasn't a problem and fits the property's old farmhouse kitchen style.

If a dishwasher is essential for your group, Portbahn House and Curlew Cottage both have them. But guests who book Shorefield seem to enjoy the charm and character more than miss any modern conveniences!

---

### Question 3: What are the bird hides at Shorefield?

The Jacksons created private bird hides in the wetlands behind the house — they were passionate birders and built these specifically for wildlife watching. The house is stocked with binoculars, bird books, and wildlife guides from their personal collection.

Islay is well known for its birdlife and there is an RSPB sanctuary at Loch Gruinart. From the hides and woodlands behind Shorefield you can watch waterfowl and woodland birds, and from the windows of the house, plentiful sea birds. It's a genuinely unique feature not typical of a holiday rental.

---

### Question 4: Is Shorefield in good condition?

Shorefield is very clean and well-maintained — cleanliness is a top priority for us (we have consistent 5-star cleanliness ratings). But it is well loved and well worn and is a bit tired in places: carpets are worn and need refreshing, furniture has been well-loved over years of family use.

This isn't a new-build rental; it's a real family home with character and personality. If you prefer modern finishes and oak floorboards, Portbahn House might suit you better. But if you'll enjoy a house with a story and authentic charm, Shorefield is wonderful.

---

### Question 5: How far is Shorefield from the beach?

Portbahn Beach is about a 5-minute walk — three sheltered bays with rock pools, safe swimming, and stunning views across Loch Indaal. You'll have it entirely to yourselves.

Port Charlotte Beach (family-friendly, sandy, shallow water) is a 5-minute drive. The dramatic west coast beaches — Machir Bay, Saligo Bay and Sanaigmore — are 10-20 minutes by car. Shorefield is perfectly positioned for coastal access.

## Curlew Cottage — New Listing & Family Features (5 Questions)

### Question 1: Why are there no reviews for Curlew Cottage yet?

Curlew is our friend and neighbour Alan's family holiday cottage, and he's opening it to guests for the first time in 2026. It's a genuine family home filled with their personal effects and "holiday things" — not a purpose-built rental.

We (Pi & Lynton) manage Curlew Cottage with the same care we give our other properties, Portbahn House and Shorefield. We hold a 4.97/5 rating across 600+ guests since 2017, with Airbnb Superhost status and a 5.0/5 communication rating. Over 30 reviews specifically mention our legendary ferry crisis support and responsiveness.

---

### Question 2: Is Curlew Cottage pet-free?

Yes — Curlew is maintained pet-free for Alan's family and for his own continued use, and for guests with allergies. Unlike our other properties, pets aren't permitted at Curlew.

If you're travelling with dogs, both Portbahn House and Shorefield welcome pets at £15 per dog per stay. Get in touch and we'll help you choose the right property for your group.

---

### Question 3: Is the walled garden safe for children?

Yes — the walled garden is fully enclosed and private, perfect for kids to play safely without supervision concerns. The property is set back from the main road along an access track, surrounded by farmland, so there's no traffic noise or road safety issues.

For families with young children or for small whisky groups, Curlew would make a great base with its combination of safe outdoor space, quiet location, and pet-free environment (great for guests with allergies). It's a peaceful, secure retreat for family holidays.

---

### Question 4: How many bedrooms does Curlew Cottage have?

Curlew has 3 bedrooms sleeping 6 guests:
- **Two bedrooms** on the main floor (accessible without stairs)
- **One twin bedroom with ensuite** accessed via a separate staircase

The separate staircase to the twin room provides extra privacy (great for teens or separate families), with the other two bedrooms accessible via the main staircase.

A note for those with mobility concerns — all bedrooms at Curlew Cottage are upstairs, although the main bathroom is downstairs. Both Portbahn House and Shorefield have bedrooms on the ground floor and may be more suitable properties.

---

### Question 5: What's the character of Curlew Cottage?

Curlew is Alan's family holiday home, complete with his family's personal effects and "holiday things" like books, games, comfortable furniture, and all the touches that make a real family home. It's cozy, authentic, and genuinely feels like *"home from home"* as guests have described our properties.

It doesn't feel like a hotel or B&B and isn't a styled, minimalist rental — it's a real family holiday cottage with personality intact. You'll find well-loved furniture, family books on the shelves, and that authentic character you don't often get from purpose-built holiday lets.
