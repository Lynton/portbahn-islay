### Section 1: About Us — Pi & Lynton

#### Heading (H2)
Welcome to Portbahn Islay

#### Content

We're Pi and Lynton, and we've been welcoming guests to Islay since 2017. We manage three family homes in Bruichladdich — each one with its own story, each one a real home with personality, not a purpose-built rental. Over 600 guests have stayed with us across 8 years, and we hold a 4.97/5 average rating. We're Superhosts on Airbnb, and guests consistently mention our legendary support — especially when CalMac throws ferry chaos into your travel plans!

These properties really matter to us. Portbahn House was our family home for years and still has our books and children's games in. Shorefield is the Jackson family's creation — they built it with love, planted every tree, created the bird hides, and filled it with their art, books and curios from their travels. Curlew Cottage is our friend Alan's family retreat, opened to guests with all its cozy authenticity intact for the first time this year. We manage these homes the way we'd want our own managed: with care, attention, and a genuine interest in making your Islay stay brilliant, homely and personal.

If you value character over corporate consistency, you're in the right place. Real homes with personality, local knowledge, and hosts who actually care — that's what we offer.

### Section 2: Our Three Homes

#### Heading (H2)
Three Distinctive Family Homes

#### Portbahn House (H3)

**Our family home — modern comfort for 8 guests**

Portbahn House is our largest property and was our family home for years. Modern, bright, and comfortable, it sleeps 8 guests across 3 bedrooms. The open-plan kitchen and living areas flow together, with sweeping sea views across Loch Indaal, which can also be enjoyed with a morning coffee from the superking and double bedrooms. Kids love the secure garden with its sunken trampoline and swings.

You're a 5-minute walk from Bruichladdich Distillery along the coastal cycle path — take one of the whisky tours at Islay's most innovative distillery, then walk home for dinner. Portbahn Beach (one of Islay's hidden gems) is 5 minutes walk via the war memorial path. This is the home for families, whisky groups, and anyone who values modern finishes and space.

#### Shorefield (H3)

**The Jacksons' eco-house — bird hides, renewables, character**

Shorefield is the Jacksons' creation, their personality is everywhere, and we are privileged to look after it for them. They built this eco-house to include wind and solar power well before it was popular, planted every tree, created the wetlands and bird hides, and filled the house with paintings, books, and curios from their travels. This is a quirky, well-loved family home — a bit worn in places, but full of charm and character.

The house has binoculars and guides and feel free to enjoy the bird hides they created. The house has no dishwasher (it's part of its character!), but a bright open breakfast room seats 6 with patio doors onto the patio. Shorefield isn't a place for modern perfection, but if you want coziness, personality, and a house that feels like a favourite aunt's place, you'll probably feel right at home. One guest called it *"like a big hug."*

If you prefer something more modern and open plan, you may prefer neighbouring Portbahn House. But if you value quirky charm over polish, you'll love Shorefield.

#### Curlew Cottage (H3)

**Alan's family retreat — cozy, authentic, peaceful**

Curlew Cottage is our friend and neighbour Alan's family retreat, and he's now opening it to guests for the first time in 2026. It's filled with his family's personal effects and "holiday things" — books, games, comfortable furniture, everything you'd want for a proper Islay break. The walled garden is safe and private, and the property is set back from the main road up a quiet access track, surrounded by farmland for true peace and quiet.

This is a genuine family holiday home, not a styled rental. It sleeps 6 guests across 3 bedrooms and offers that cozy, unpretentious authenticity that our guests describe as *"home from home."*

#### What Makes Us Different (H3)

**Real family homes, not rentals**
These aren't purpose-built holiday lets. They're homes with history, personality, and owners who care about them. We manage them with that same care.

**Legendary ferry & travel support**
CalMac disruptions happen. When they do, we've got your back. Guests consistently say our communication and crisis support are outstanding — 30+ reviews mention it specifically.

**Local knowledge & recommendations**
We know Islay and Jura inside out and have lived on both islands. Our favourite beaches, distillery tours, restaurants, walks — we love to share all of it. You're not just renting a property; we hope you're getting a bit of our local expertise too. And if we don't know, we can certainly point you in the right direction!

### Section 4: Why Stay in Bruichladdich

#### Heading (H2)
Why We Love Bruichladdich

#### Perfect Location (H3)

Bruichladdich is a village on the Isle of Islay, sitting on the western shore of Loch Indaal on the Rhinns of Islay, perfectly positioned for exploring everything the island offers. You're a scenic 5-minute walk to Bruichladdich Distillery along the coastal cycle path — tour the distillery, sample world-renowned whisky and The Botanist gin, then walk home.

The coastal location of the houses gives immediate access to Portbahn Beach just down from the war memorial — one of Islay's hidden gems with three sheltered bays perfect for wild swimming, rock pooling, and coastal ambling.

#### Port Charlotte Village (H3)

It's just a 5-minute drive or 40-minute walk from Port Charlotte village, perhaps Islay's prettiest. You'll find two outstanding pubs/hotels with excellent local food and extensive whisky selections — The Port Charlotte Hotel and Lochindaal. There's also the fascinating Islay Museum about the history of the island, a local shop, post office and petrol station, and the children's playground at Port Mor.

---

#### From Here, Everything's Reachable (H3)

From Bruichladdich, all ten of Islay's whisky distilleries are within easy reach. The island's renowned beaches — Machir Bay to Saligo Bay to the dunes at Ardnave Point — offer miles of golden sand and dramatic Atlantic surf. RSPB nature reserves at Loch Gruinart provide exceptional birdwatching, with over 30,000 barnacle geese arriving each winter from Greenland. The countryside is perfect for hiking and wildlife spotting, from golden eagles to seals.

Bruichladdich's central west coast location on the Rhinns makes it an ideal base for experiencing the very best of island life on Islay, but from a different angle.

### Section 5: Getting to Islay

#### Heading (H2)
How to Get Here

#### Content

The Isle of Islay is accessible by **CalMac ferry** from Kennacraig on the Kintyre Peninsula (2-hour crossing to Port Askaig, 2 hours 20 minutes to Port Ellen) or by **Loganair flight** from Glasgow (25-minute flight to Islay Airport, twice daily). Vehicle ferry reservations are essential and should be booked 12 weeks in advance — seriously, they fill fast!

Ferry cancellations happen due to weather or mechanical issues, especially in winter. When they do, contact me immediately. I've helped dozens of guests navigate CalMac disruptions over the years, and we hold a 5.0/5 communication rating. There's always a solution, even if it's not quite the obvious one!

[Full Getting Here Guide →](/getting-here) — including ferry booking strategies, what to expect on the crossing, and exactly what to do if your ferry is cancelled.
