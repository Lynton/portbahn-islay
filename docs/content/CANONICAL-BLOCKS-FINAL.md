## TIER 1: Existing Blocks (from current content)

### Block 1: `ferry-basics`

**Entity Type:** Travel
**Canonical Home:** Getting Here, Section 2
**Teaser Used On:** Homepage, Property pages

#### Full Version

The Isle of Islay is a Scottish island in the Inner Hebrides, accessible by CalMac ferry from Kennacraig on the Kintyre Peninsula. Ferries run to two ports on Islay — Port Ellen (2 hours 20 minutes crossing) and Port Askaig (2 hours crossing). Both ports are approximately 30-40 minutes' drive from our Bruichladdich properties.

You have to book a ferry to a specific port rather than just to "Islay", so which port will depend on what time you are travelling. The crossing offers beautiful views across the Sound of Jura.

Vehicle reservations are absolutely essential and should be booked up to 12 weeks in advance, especially during peak season and whisky festival periods in late May. We can't emphasise this enough. Book your ferry as soon as you book your accommodation if you can.

#### Teaser Version

The Isle of Islay is accessible by CalMac ferry from Kennacraig (2 hours to Port Askaig, 2 hours 20 minutes to Port Ellen) or by Loganair flight from Glasgow (25 minutes). Vehicle ferry reservations are essential — book 12 weeks in advance. [Full Getting Here Guide →](/getting-here)

**Entity Type:** Location
**Canonical Home:** Homepage, Section 4 (Why We Love Bruichladdich)
**Teaser Used On:** Property pages, Explore Islay

#### Full Version

Bruichladdich is a village on the Isle of Islay, sitting on the western shore of Loch Indaal on the Rhinns of Islay, perfectly positioned for exploring everything the island offers. You're a scenic 5-minute walk to Bruichladdich Distillery along the coastal cycle path — tour the distillery, sample world-renowned whisky and The Botanist gin, then walk home.

The coastal location of the houses gives immediate access to Portbahn Beach just down from the war memorial — one of Islay's hidden gems with three sheltered bays perfect for wild swimming, rock pooling, and coastal ambling.

### Block 5: `portbahn-beach`

**Entity Type:** Place
**Canonical Home:** Explore Islay, Section 3 (Beaches)
**Teaser Used On:** Homepage, Property pages

#### Full Version

Portbahn Beach is our hidden gem — literally 5 minutes from our door via the war memorial path. It's three small, sheltered bays tucked into the coastline with stunning views across Loch Indaal. Safe for swimming, perfect for rock pooling with kids, and never ever crowded.

You'll nearly always have it entirely to yourselves. Kids love the rock pools at low tide. The water around Islay is cold (10-14°C typical), but it's sheltered enough for a quick dip if you're brave. One guest wrote: *"Better than the pictures — we had breakfast on Portbahn Beach every morning and saw seals."*

This is genuinely one of Islay's best kept secrets, and it's our local spot so yours to explore from the moment you arrive.

#### Teaser Version

Portbahn Beach is 5 minutes' walk via the war memorial path — three sheltered bays, safe swimming, rock pools, and you'll usually have it entirely to yourselves. One of Islay's hidden gems. [More about Islay's beaches →](/explore-islay#islays-beaches)

### Block 6: `shorefield-character`

**Entity Type:** Property
**Canonical Home:** Shorefield property page
**Teaser Used On:** Homepage, Explore Islay

#### Full Version

Shorefield is the Jackson family's creation — they built this eco-house powered by wind and solar, planted every tree on the property, created the wetlands and bird hides, and filled the house with paintings, books, and curios from their travels around the world.

It's quirky, full of personality, and a bit tired in places — carpets need refreshing and furniture has been well-loved. This isn't a styled rental; it's a real family home. If you prefer bright, modern open-plan simplicity, Portbahn House would suit you well. But if you value character, cosiness, and a house that feels like *"a big hug"* (as one guest said), Shorefield would make a wonderful stay.

**Entity Type:** Activity
**Canonical Home:** Explore Islay, Section 2
**Teaser Used On:** Homepage, Property FAQs

#### Full Version

Islay has ten working whisky distilleries, and you're a 5-minute walk from one of the world's best and certainly most innovative. A quick guide to help you plan your visits:

**The ten distilleries:**
1. **Ardbeg** — Intensely peated, cult following, stunning coastal location, wonderful café
2. **Lagavulin** — Classic Islay style, 16-year flagship, accessible from Port Ellen
3. **Laphroaig** — Medicinal, iodine notes, right on the shore, love it or hate it!
4. **Bowmore** — Claims to be Islay's oldest (1779), balanced peat, town centre location
5. **Bruichladdich** — Innovative and radical; world's most heavily peated as well as unpeated expressions + The Botanist gin, **5-minute walk from our properties**
6. **Kilchoman** — Farm distillery, barley to bottle on-site, very visitor-friendly, great café for lunch
7. **Bunnahabhain** — Gentle, mostly unpeated, remote northern location with stunning views of Paps of Jura
8. **Caol Ila** — Largest Islay producer, used in Johnnie Walker, Port Askaig, dramatic setting
9. **Ardnahoe** — Recent (opened 2018), Port Askaig, new releases, still maturing their stock, great café
10. **Port Ellen** — Newest (closed 1983, reopened 2024), Port Ellen, limited releases of old stock, maturing new

**Our Recommendation:** Start with Bruichladdich — it's our nearest distillery, an easy 5-minute walk along the coastal path and it really is unique. As a bonus you can walk home afterward without worrying about driving.

**Canonical Home:** Explore Islay, Section 4
**Teaser Used On:** Homepage

#### Full Version

Over 30,000 barnacle geese arrive from Greenland each October, spending winter on Islay before returning north in April. RSPB Loch Gruinart reserve is the best viewing location — the morning flights as thousands of geese lift from the loch are spectacular. The sound is unforgettable.

If you're visiting between October and April, witnessing the geese is a highlight. Arrive at Loch Gruinart at dawn for the best show. Guests who've experienced this consistently describe it as one of their trip highlights.

### Block 10: `food-drink-islay`

**Entity Type:** Activity
**Canonical Home:** Explore Islay, Section 5
**Teaser Used On:** Homepage

#### Full Version

Islay's food scene emphasises local seafood, lamb, and whisky. Dining out isn't cheap, but quality is high. Most guests cook several meals in our well-equipped kitchens and eat out selectively. Here's where we recommend:

**Our Top Recommendations:**

**Lochindaal Seafood Kitchen, Port Charlotte**
This is truly exceptional, run with huge heart by Jack and his father Iain — seafood platters from the local fishermen's catch, featuring local oysters, langoustines, crab, and mussels among others. You do need to order the full platter 24 hours ahead, but it's really worth planning around. Small, cozy venue in Port Charlotte with two bars. Book ahead — it fills fast. Our guests consistently rave about this place. Also a great whisky selection if you just want to drop in for a pint or a dram.

**Port Charlotte Hotel**
Scottish fare and an outstanding whisky bar with 300+ bottles on their single malt menu. The restaurant takes bookings (advised), but the bar is walk-in. Good Sunday roasts. Graeme and his wife run it beautifully. We send guests here regularly, and they're never disappointed. Traditional Scottish live music on Wednesdays and Sundays is popular and a lovely way to spend an evening by a roaring log fire, dram in hand.

**An Tigh Seinnse, Portnahaven**
Traditional little village pub at the end of the Rhinns, with home-cooked food and local charm in possibly Islay's most remote coastal village. Small, authentic, popular with locals and visitors. Book ahead — it's worth the 20-minute drive from Bruichladdich. You can nearly always spot seals in Portnahaven harbour, just outside the pub.

**Other Options:**
- **Peatzeria, Bowmore** — Creative wood-fired pizzas with Islay twists, casual, family-friendly
- **Bowmore town centre** — Chinese and Indian takeaways, fish and chips, bakery, butcher
- **Distillery cafés** — Ardbeg (great café, good lunch stop), Ardnahoe (visitor centre, food & drink), Kilchoman (café, farm distillery)

**Groceries & Self-Catering:**
- **Aileen's Mini-Market, Bruichladdich** (5-minute walk) — Coffee, bacon rolls, newspapers, basic groceries, post office. A Bruichladdich institution, known locally as "Debbie's". Start your morning here after a heavy day of distillery visits!
- **Bowmore Co-op** (15-minute drive) — The biggest "supermarket" on Islay. Fresh produce, meat, alcohol, household supplies.
- **Jean's Fresh Fish Van** — Visits villages weekly with fresh local fish and seafood.

Most guests cook several meals during their stay. Dining out every night adds up quickly — expect £40-60 per person for dinner with drinks.

#### Teaser Version

### Block 11: `beaches-overview`

**Entity Type:** Place
**Canonical Home:** Explore Islay, Section 3 (expanded)
**Teaser Used On:** Homepage

#### Full Version

Islay's coastline offers dozens of beaches, and you'll often have miles of sand entirely to yourselves. Let me highlight our favourites and the ones guests ask about most:

**Safe Swimming Beaches:**
- **Portbahn Beach** — Our hidden gem, 5 min walk, 3 sheltered bays, safe swimming, rock pools
- **Port Charlotte Beach** — 5 min drive, family-friendly, shallow, sandy
- **Laggan Bay / Airport Beach** — Long, shallow, sandy, safe for swimming
- **Kilnaughton Bay** — Near Port Ellen, family-friendly, shallow, safe

**Dramatic Atlantic Beaches (NOT safe for swimming):**
- **Machir Bay** — Islay's most famous, 2 miles of golden sand, dramatic but DANGEROUS currents
- **Saligo Bay** — Dramatic Atlantic, NOT safe for swimming
- **Sanaigmore** — Rock formations, art gallery with coffee/cakes
- **Ardnave Point** — Massive sand dunes, remote, beautiful

**Hidden Gems:**
- **Singing Sands** — Beautiful remote beach, worth the walk
- **Claggain Bay** — Secluded, lovely coastal walk to reach it
- **Port Ellen town beach** — Convenient if staying near the ferry

**CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING:** Machir Bay, Saligo Bay, and Sanaigmore are **not safe for swimming**. Strong currents, undertows, and cold Atlantic conditions make these "drowning beaches" as locals call them. Admire them, walk them, photograph them, but don't enter the water.

For swimming, stick to Loch Indaal beaches (Portbahn, Port Charlotte) or the southeast coast (Laggan Bay, Kilnaughton). Bring a wetsuit if you're planning extended swimming — water is cold year-round (10-14°C).

### Block 13: `jura-day-trip`

**Entity Type:** Activity
**Canonical Home:** Jura page
**Teaser Used On:** Explore Islay, Getting Here

#### Full Version

Jura is just a 5-minute ferry ride from Port Askaig, but it feels like a different world. With one road, one distillery, one pub, and more deer than people (6,000+ red deer to ~200 residents), it's Islay's wilder, quieter neighbour.

**Getting There:**
The small car ferry runs frequently from Port Askaig. No booking needed for foot passengers — just turn up. Short queue for cars, but check the timetable for last ferry times.

**A Perfect Day Trip:**
1. **Morning ferry** from Port Askaig (5 minutes)
2. **Jura Distillery tour** — Book ahead for tours, or drop in for a dram
3. **Lunch** at the Antlers (pub food, friendly atmosphere) or Jura Hotel (restaurant dining)
4. **Afternoon** — Hire bikes and cycle to Small Isles Bay / Corran Sands, or walk the coastal path
5. **Wildlife** — Red deer everywhere, often on the roadside
6. **Views** — The Paps of Jura dominate every vista
7. **Return ferry** — Check timetable for last sailing

**Tips:**
- Bikes can be hired on Jura — a lovely way to explore
- The single-track road is quiet, but watch for deer
- Mobile signal is patchy — download maps beforehand
- The pace is slower than Islay — embrace it

#### Teaser Version

A 5-minute ferry from Port Askaig takes you to Jura — visit the distillery, lunch at the Antlers, cycle to Small Isles Bay. It feels like a different world. [Jura day trip guide →](/jura)

### Block 14: `jura-longer-stay`

**Entity Type:** Activity
**Canonical Home:** Jura page
**Teaser Used On:** —

#### Full Version

For those wanting to explore Jura properly, a longer stay rewards you with experiences you simply can't fit into a day:

**Barnhill & George Orwell:**
At the remote northern tip of Jura, Barnhill is where George Orwell wrote *1984* in 1946-48. The house still stands (now holiday rental), and the journey to reach it — 25 miles of single-track road, the last 8 miles unpaved — is an adventure in itself. Literary pilgrims love this.

**Corryvreckan Whirlpool:**
The third largest whirlpool in the world churns between Jura and Scarba. Visible from the northern tip of Jura, it's most dramatic at certain tides. Orwell nearly drowned here in 1947 — nearly lost the manuscript of *1984*. Boat trips from Islay (Islay Boat Tours) or Jura (Jura Boat Tours) get you close.

**Climb a Pap:**
The three Paps of Jura (Beinn an Oir is the highest at 785m) are serious hill walks — not technical, but steep and remote. A clear day rewards you with views to Ireland, Mull, and the mainland. Not for novices, but achievable for fit hikers.

**The West Coast:**
Jura's Atlantic west coast is one of Britain's wildest landscapes — raised beaches, caves, no roads, no people. Walking it requires planning and fitness, but it's genuinely remote in a way few places in Britain can match.

**K Foundation:**
For pop culture pilgrims: the boathouse where the KLF's Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty burned £1 million in 1994 is on Jura's west coast.

**Wildlife:**
Red deer are everywhere — you'll see dozens daily. Eagles soar over the Paps. Seals and otters inhabit the coastline.

**The Pace:**
Even slower than Islay. One shop, one hotel, one pub, one distillery. If you want true escape, this is it.

### Block 16: `about-us`

**Entity Type:** Trust
**Canonical Home:** About page
**Teaser Used On:** —

#### Full Version

We're Pi and Lynton, and we've been welcoming guests to Islay since 2017. We started by letting out our own family home, Portbahn House, and now manage three properties in Bruichladdich — each one with its own story.

Portbahn House was our family home for years. Our books are still on the shelves, our children's games still in the cupboards. Shorefield is the Jacksons' creation — they built it, planted every tree, created the bird hides, and filled it with their art and travels. Curlew Cottage is our friend Alan's family retreat, now opening to guests for the first time.

These aren't purpose-built holiday lets — they're real family homes with personality. We manage them the way we'd want our own managed: with care, attention, and a genuine interest in making your stay brilliant.

We now live on Jura (one more ferry away!), where we built Bothan Jura Retreat from scratch — the kind of place we'd want to escape to ourselves. A hot tub at the foot of the Paps, under the stars.

We try to create the sort of places we like to stay when we go away — a genuine home from home. That's always been our philosophy, and guests tell us it comes through in the way we manage our properties and communicate throughout the booking process.

If you have any questions about Islay, Jura, our properties, or anything else — just get in touch. We love helping guests plan their trips.

Pi, Lynton and Amba

## Implementation Notes

### Sanity Schema Requirements

Each block needs:
```javascript
{
  _type: 'canonicalBlock',
  blockId: 'string', // e.g., 'ferry-basics'
  entityType: 'string', // e.g., 'Travel'
  canonicalHome: 'string', // Page slug
  fullContent: 'portableText',
  teaserContent: 'portableText',
  keyFacts: [{
    fact: 'string',
    value: 'string'
  }]
}
```

### Page References

Pages reference blocks with render mode:
```javascript
{
  _type: 'blockReference',
  block: reference, // → canonicalBlock
  renderAs: 'full' | 'teaser'
}
```

### Content Updates

When updating a block:
1. Edit the canonical block document only
2. All pages using that block update automatically
3. Key Facts table ensures consistency
