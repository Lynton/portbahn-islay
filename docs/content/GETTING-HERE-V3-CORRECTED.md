### Section 1: Pi's Welcome

#### Heading (H2)
Getting to the Isle of Islay

#### Content

Travel to Islay is not straightforward. You don't come to the Scottish islands if you want easy! You come because of the adventure and for an experience you can't get on the mainland.

Make the journey part of the experience. Twenty minutes outside Glasgow, after you pass Dumbarton, you are at Loch Lomond and from there you have two hours of some of the most beautiful scenery on earth, followed by a ferry journey to unwind.

We now live on Jura (a second ferry journey away!), but lived on Islay for a few years before that. We are very familiar with all the ins and outs of getting on and off the islands and dodging winter storms or summer rushes. We have been helping hundreds of guests make their trip successfully since we first let out our own home, Portbahn House, in 2017, so if you have any questions or fears do just get in touch.

### Section 2: Travel Overview

#### Heading (H2)
Your Route Options

#### By Ferry (H3)

> **BLOCK REF:** `ferry-basics` — `renderAs: full`

#### By Air (H3)

Loganair operates daily flights from Glasgow to Islay Airport, with the flight taking approximately 25 minutes. Islay Airport is 30 minutes' drive from our properties. Two flights typically operate daily (one on weekends), first thing in the morning and at around 5pm in the afternoon.

This option suits travellers preferring speed over scenery, though the ferry crossing itself is such a special part of the island experience.

#### Journey Time (H3)

Your journey to Islay typically represents a full travel day, so plan on that and enjoy it. Stop at Loch Lomond for a picnic, at Loch Fyne for seafood lunch (with an amazing garden centre and café next door!); or at historic Inveraray with its jail and castle.

From Glasgow, expect minimum 5-6 hours travel time door-to-door via ferry (3 hours driving to Kennacraig + 2-hour crossing + onward travel). Most guests find the ferry crossing atmospheric and enjoyable, weather permitting. We recommend treating your first and last days as travel days rather than packing in activities.

### Section 3: Booking the Ferry

#### Heading (H2)
How to Book Your Ferry Crossing

#### Booking Timeline (H3)

**Book 12 weeks in advance** for vehicle spaces — CalMac ferries fill quickly, particularly for summer dates, school holidays, and Fèis Ìle (the whisky festival in late May). Foot passengers have more flexibility but should still pre-book to secure a space.

The CalMac booking system releases spaces 12 weeks ahead. Set a calendar reminder to book exactly at that point for peak summer weeks. This isn't overcautious — we have had guests miss out by booking just days late.

A really important note: if there isn't the exact crossing you want, book the closest you can. Ferry bookings change daily and if you have enough time before you travel you will almost certainly be able to change it. But get a reservation in the system!

#### Which Port to Choose (H3)

**Port Askaig is marginally closer** to Bruichladdich (25 minutes vs 40 minutes from Port Ellen), but both routes work equally well and the choice of port will be dictated by the sailing times, so don't worry overly. Check which sailing times suit your schedule — Port Ellen and Port Askaig ferries operate on different timetables throughout the day.

#### Booking Tips (H3)

- Book online at calmac.co.uk as soon as your dates are confirmed
- If you can't get the exact dates you want, book the closest you can and ring regularly — spaces are freed up daily
- Consider booking return crossings as "flexi" tickets if your dates might change
- Standard tickets cost less but cannot be changed or refunded
- Foot passengers are charged separately from vehicles
- Check for any advance purchase discounts or Islander cards if you're a frequent visitor

### Section 4: Ferry Survival Guide

#### Heading (H2)
What to Expect on the Crossing

#### Before Boarding (H3)

Arrive at Kennacraig ferry terminal 30-45 minutes before departure. The marshalling area has toilets and a small waiting room with vending machine. Once you drive onto the ferry, leave your car and head upstairs to the passenger lounges — you cannot remain in your vehicle during crossing. Pets are allowed aboard on the passenger deck.

#### On Board (H3)

The ferry has a restaurant serving hot food, snacks, and drinks (including Islay whisky). Seats are available inside and on outdoor decks. The crossing is generally smooth, though the open water section can be choppy in windy conditions.

Most guests find it relaxing rather than rough. On clear days, views of the Paps of Jura and the Kintyre coastline are spectacular and you pass by Gigha. It's not uncommon to spot seals, occasionally dolphins, and you regularly see the giant Lion's Mane jellyfish from the deck. One of my guests recently said, *"The crossing was part of the holiday"* — and I hear that a lot.

#### Sea Sickness Tips (H3)

If you're prone to motion sickness, sit near the centre of the vessel on the lower passenger deck where movement is minimised. Avoid reading or looking at screens — focus on the horizon instead. The café sells basic remedies, but if you want actual travel sickness pills such as Stugeron, Kwells or Dramamine, you'll need to bring your own.

#### What Guests Tell Us (H3)

The ferry journey is genuinely enjoyable for most visitors. Use the time to decompress, read your Islay guidebook, or simply watch the scenery. By the time you arrive, you're already in island mode.

### Section 5: Ferry Chaos Survival Guide

#### Heading (H2)
When Ferry Cancellations Happen

#### Why Cancellations Occur (H3)

Weather is the main culprit — wind gusts above 40-45mph can prevent safe boarding or crossing. CalMac also occasionally suspends sailings due to mechanical issues (the fleet is ageing) or industrial action. Winter months see more disruptions than summer, but cancellations can happen any time of year.

Be prepared: call ahead, keep an eye on the weather, and sign up for CalMac travel alerts.

#### Our Ferry Chaos Track Record & What to Do (H3)

> **BLOCK REF:** `ferry-support` — `renderAs: full`

#### Flexible Tickets (H3)

If you book "flexi" tickets (slightly more expensive than standard), you can change your sailing without penalty. This provides peace of mind if you're worried about disruption, particularly for winter bookings.

#### Travel Insurance (H3)

We very strongly recommend travel insurance that covers ferry cancellations. Weather disruptions are rare but possible, and insurance protects your accommodation costs if you cannot reach Islay on your planned dates. Most travel policies include "delayed departure" cover.

We cannot refund your accommodation costs if your ferry is disrupted or you miss it unfortunately, so make sure you are properly covered in your insurance.

#### Our Commitment (H3)

If ferry disruption affects your arrival or departure, contact me immediately. We can usually accommodate late arrivals or adjust check-out times or even stay an extra night or put you up at one of our other properties. In 8+ years of hosting hundreds of guests, we've never had a booking completely collapse due to CalMac — there's always a solution, even if it means thinking outside the box!

### Section 6: Flying to Islay

#### Heading (H2)
Flying from Glasgow

#### Flight Details (H3)

**Loganair operates two flights daily** (one on Sundays) between Glasgow and Islay Airport. Flight time is approximately 25 minutes, with stunning aerial views of the islands on clear days. The aircraft are small (typically 20-30 passengers), and hand luggage space is limited. Check baggage allowances when booking.

#### Islay Airport (H3)

**Islay Airport** is one of Scotland's smallest and most scenic airports, located on the southern tip of the island. The airport terminal has limited facilities — essentially a single room with check-in desks. Don't expect shops or lounges and sadly the café isn't running at the moment. There is just a vending machine once you are through security. But the experience is charming and efficient.

#### From Airport to Bruichladdich (H3)

The drive takes about 30 minutes via A846 through Bowmore and around the head of Loch Indaal. Car hire is available at the airport through Islay Car Hire — book in advance, especially in summer. Taxis should also be pre-booked, but there is no "ready to go" taxi rank. You must arrange onward travel in advance.

#### Cost Considerations (H3)

Flights are significantly more expensive than ferries, particularly if travelling as a family or with luggage. It averages £100+ per person each way. However, flying saves 4+ hours of travel time each way and avoids potential ferry disruptions. Many guests fly one direction and ferry the other to experience both.

#### Weather Considerations When Flying (H3)

While the ferries are disrupted by the wind, it is low cloud that disrupts the flights. Islay Airport does not have radar required to allow landing in poor visibility and the pilots must be able to see the runway clearly to land.

A general rule of thumb: if you can see the other side of Loch Indaal the plane can land. If you can't, it won't!

This can mean some strategic planning — low cloud, get the ferry; high winds, take the plane.

If you're not sure, get in touch and we'll help.

### Section 7: Getting Around Islay

#### Heading (H2)
Do You Need a Car on Islay?

#### Short Answer (H3)

**Yes, a car is strongly recommended.** Islay has limited public transport, and taxis must be booked in advance. Most distilleries, beaches, and attractions require driving to reach. The freedom to explore at your own pace is essential to enjoying the island.

#### Car Hire (H3)

- **Islay Car Hire** operates from the airport and ferry ports
- Book well in advance, especially for summer and Fèis Ìle dates
- Expect small, practical vehicles — no luxury fleet, but perfectly adequate
- Daily rates are reasonable; weekly rates offer better value

#### Driving on Islay (H3)

The main roads allow traffic in both directions, but some parts of the island have single-track roads with passing places. Locals use passing places to allow faster traffic to overtake, not just for oncoming vehicles. Driving is relaxed and unhurried — expect wildlife on roads (sheep, cattle, birds).

You'll also notice oncoming drivers waving at you or, more commonly, lifting a finger off the wheel or nodding — this is the famous Islay wave, a simple friendly bit of courtesy acknowledging other drivers. Don't panic! Reciprocate if you feel like it! It's part of island culture.

#### Distances from Bruichladdich (H3)

- Bruichladdich Distillery: 5-minute walk
- Port Charlotte (restaurants, shops): 5-minute drive / 40-minute walk
- Port Ellen ferry terminal: 35 minutes drive
- Port Askaig ferry terminal: 25 minutes drive
- Machir Bay beach: 15 minutes drive
- Ardbeg / Lagavulin / Laphroaig distilleries: 40-50 minutes drive

#### Drinking and Driving (H3)

Scotland's drink-drive limit is effectively zero. If you're touring distilleries, designate a driver who takes the "driver's dram" away to enjoy later at your accommodation. Most distilleries provide these complimentary takeaway samples for drivers.

### Section 8: Planning Your Journey

#### Heading (H2)
Practical Tips for Islay Travel

#### How Many Days? (H3)

- **Minimum:** 2-3 nights allows time to visit 3-4 distilleries and see main beaches
- **Recommended:** 5-7 nights for leisurely exploration, Jura day trip, wildlife watching
- **Whisky-focused:** 3-4 full days to visit 5-6 distilleries comfortably

Remember your first and last days are mostly travel. A week-long stay gives you 5 genuine activity days. Our guests who book for 7+ nights consistently tell us they wish they'd had longer. Also consider including a couple of days on Jura, a dramatically different island, to really experience this part of the Hebrides. We have accommodation on Jura and can help plan visits to both islands.

#### Best Time to Visit (H3)

- **April-June:** Sunniest months, good weather, fewer crowds, reasonable prices
- **July-August:** Warmest (relatively), busiest, school holiday premium
- **Late May:** Fèis Ìle whisky festival — book accommodation and ferry 12+ weeks ahead
- **September-October:** Barnacle geese arrive (30,000+ birds), beautiful autumn light
- **Winter (November-March):** Dramatic weather, limited daylight, some distilleries closed

#### What to Pack (H3)

- Waterproof jacket and layers (weather changes rapidly)
- Walking boots or sturdy shoes for coastal paths and beaches
- Binoculars for wildlife (optional but recommended)
- Sunglasses and sunscreen (surprising amounts of sun between showers)
- Your own beach towels or dog towels if bringing pets (we provide bath towels only)

Once you're on the island, our full guide to distilleries, beaches, wildlife, restaurants, and family activities has everything you need to plan your days. [Explore Islay →](/explore-islay)

## Embedded FAQs

### How far in advance should I book the ferry?

Book 12 weeks ahead for vehicle spaces. CalMac releases bookings 12 weeks in advance, and ferries fill quickly for summer dates and Fèis Ìle (late May). Foot passengers have more flexibility but should still pre-book. I've seen guests miss out by booking just days late for peak weeks. If there isn't availability for your exact dates, book the closest you can then ring up regularly — spaces are freed up daily.

---

### What happens if my ferry is cancelled?

Contact me immediately — I've helped dozens of guests navigate CalMac disruptions. CalMac will usually contact you directly; their helpline is 0800 066 5000. Sign up for ferry status alerts by texting "calmac subscribe 09" to 60030. We strongly recommend travel insurance covering delayed departure. One guest wrote: *"Pi looked after us like family during the ferry chaos."*

---

### Do I need to hire a car on Islay?

Yes, a car is strongly recommended. Public transport is limited, and most distilleries, beaches, and attractions require driving. Car hire is available at the airport and ferry ports through Islay Car Hire — book in advance. You can walk to Bruichladdich Distillery (5 minutes) and Port Charlotte (40 minutes), but broader exploration needs a vehicle.

---

### Can I change my ferry booking?

Standard CalMac tickets are non-refundable but can usually be changed easily by calling the ferry office. "Flexi" tickets (slightly more expensive) allow changes more easily. If you're unsure about dates or worried about weather disruption, flexi tickets provide peace of mind — and they're worth every penny. The CalMac staff are helpful so give the office a call to help plan your travel.

---

### How long is the ferry crossing?

The ferry crossing from Kennacraig takes 2 hours to Port Askaig or 2 hours 20 minutes to Port Ellen. The entire journey from Glasgow to Bruichladdich (including 3-hour drive to Kennacraig and onward travel from the ferry) takes 5-6 hours minimum. Plan for a full travel day each direction.
