#### Heading (H2)
Explore the Isle of Islay

#### Content

Having lived and worked on Islay for a number of years, we know the island well and want to share a few of our favourite things to do here and why we love Bruichladdich, Port Charlotte and the Rhinns so much.

The Isle of Islay is one of Scotland's Inner Hebrides islands, renowned worldwide for its ten working single malt whisky distilleries. It's also one of the UK's most important destinations for birdwatching, with the annual geese migration a huge event.

Located in the southwestern approaches to the Scottish mainland, across from the Kintyre Peninsula, Islay spans approximately 25 miles at its widest point. The island delivers a really special combination: world-class whisky, dramatic Atlantic coastline, abundant wildlife, and that slower pace of island life that our guests often describe as "exactly what we needed."

Our properties sit around Bruichladdich village on the Rhinns of Islay, all with sea views overlooking Loch Indaal. You're just a 5-minute walk from Bruichladdich Distillery along the coastal cycle path and also the local minimarket with a good selection of basic provisions, whisky and great coffee. From here, everything Islay offers is within easy reach — distillery tours, hidden beaches, RSPB reserves, and local restaurants.

Most visitors come for the whisky, a lot for the bird life, but stay for everything else. Beaches stretch for miles with minimal footfall — Machir Bay at Kilchoman is just wonderful. Over 30,000 barnacle geese arrive each winter from Greenland. Golden eagles and sea eagles patrol the skies. Wild swimming, dark sky stargazing, and coastal walks fill the days between distillery visits. One guest recently said: *"We came for Bruichladdich, but Portbahn Beach and the bird hides at Shorefield stole our hearts."*

We really hope you enjoy your stay with us and we'd love to help you make the most of your time on Islay. Just get in touch if you have any questions.

#### Our Recommendation: Start at Bruichladdich (H3)

Tour Bruichladdich first — it's our nearest distillery, an easy 5-minute walk along the coastal path and it really is unique.

Bruichladdich are one of the most creative whisky distillers in Scotland, driving the importance of terroir and provenance throughout all their single malts, releasing very limited editions of single farm, single vintage and single barley varieties each year in their Islay Barley and Bere Barley ranges. They are also quite special in that their malts range from the unpeated Laddie Classic, through a more traditionally Islay heavily peated Port Charlotte, to the world's peatiest whisky, the highly exclusive Octomore range.

For gin lovers, the distillery is also the home of the world-class, award-winning Botanist Gin. There is genuinely something for everybody at Bruichladdich which is why it makes such a good first visit.

Distillery tours and whisky tastings, particularly the warehouse experience, are truly excellent, personal and a fascinating insight into the pedigree of whisky in quite a different way.

As a bonus you can walk home afterward without worrying about driving. We recommend this to every guest, and the feedback is always very positive. It really is the one place we would urge you to go if you are only going to one distillery.

From there, plan your distillery days based on your whisky preferences. Heavily peated? Focus on the short stretch of the southern coast that contains Ardbeg, Lagavulin, and Laphroaig (the south coast "killers"). A bit softer with more balance? Bowmore. Small and traditional — head for Kilchoman and have lunch at the café. Or, for something gentler, Bunnahabhain produces beautiful unpeated malts. And if you want to see whisky production at scale and with technology, head for Caol Ila or Ardnahoe.

---

#### Booking Distillery Tours (H3)

Book tours in advance — essential for summer dates and absolutely critical for Fèis Ìle (the whisky festival in late May). Most distilleries limit tour sizes and fill up weeks ahead. Tours typically run 10am-4pm with limited afternoon slots. Check individual distillery websites for availability and prices.

Most distilleries offer standard tours (45-60 minutes, £10-15) plus premium experiences with warehouse tastings or rare drams (£40-80+). If you're serious about whisky, the premium tours are worth it.

---

#### How Many Distilleries Per Day? (H3)

Two per day is comfortable. Three can become rushed and overwhelming. It also depends where you are heading. It makes sense to visit Ardbeg, Laphroaig and Lagavulin as a trio since they are so close, perhaps along with recently reopened Port Ellen. Ardbeg has a great café so you can break the day with lunch there.

On the north coast, Caol Ila, Bunnahabhain and Ardnahoe sit along the Sound of Islay facing the Jura Paps and make another good set, with good food and drinks at Ardnahoe visitor centre.

Something to remember — do factor in travel time between distilleries (some are 45+ minutes apart), and remember that tastings accumulate quickly. Pace yourself and actually enjoy the experience rather than ticking boxes.

Our whisky groups typically tour 5-6 distilleries over 3-4 full days, with beach walks and meals in between. That rhythm seems to work really well.

And make sure you leave time for Islay's other attractions, most importantly, the pace of life!

---

#### Drinking and Driving (H3)

Scotland's drink-drive limit is effectively zero — take this seriously. Distilleries provide "driver's drams" — takeaway miniatures for designated drivers to enjoy later at your accommodation. This system works well. Let them know who's driving when you arrive for a tasting and they'll usually help you out.

Alternatively, hire a guide or taxi for distillery days. We can recommend local drivers who specialise in distillery tours if you'd prefer not to worry about limits.

### Section 3: Beaches & Swimming

#### Heading (H2)
Islay's Beaches

#### Intro Paragraph
Islay's coastline offers dozens of beaches, and you'll often have miles of sand entirely to yourselves. Let me highlight our favourites and the ones guests ask about most.

---

#### Portbahn Beach: Our Hidden Gem (H3)

> **BLOCK REF:** `portbahn-beach` — `renderAs: full`

---

#### Port Charlotte Beach (H3)

Port Charlotte Beach is a 5-minute drive from our properties — sandy, sheltered, perfect for families. The water is shallow and safe for swimming. Kids can paddle safely, and there's easy parking adjacent to the village. Pop into Port Charlotte afterward for coffee or lunch at The Port Charlotte Hotel or Lochindaal.

---

#### The Big Atlantic Beaches (H3)

**Machir Bay** is Islay's most famous beach — 2 miles of golden sand backed by dunes, with dramatic Atlantic surf and stunning sunsets. It's spectacular for walks. Head northwards up the coast towards Opera House Rocks if you want expansive skies, crashing waves and eagles for company. Or head south and walk over the top to the old ruined chapel at Kilchiaran.

**Sanaigmore** is a dramatic stretch of northern coast to explore with great rock formations for playing hide and seek. There is also a lovely small art gallery serving coffee and cakes.

**CRITICAL WARNING:** Machir Bay and the west coast beaches (Saligo Bay, Sanaigmore) are **not safe for swimming**. Strong currents, undertows, and cold Atlantic conditions make these "drowning beaches" as locals call them. Admire them, walk them, photograph them, but don't enter the water. There have been a number of close calls over the years. And remember, the RNLI and coastguard are volunteers.

---

#### Safe Swimming Beaches (H3)

For actual swimming, stick to:
- **Loch Indaal beaches** (Portbahn Beach, Port Charlotte) — sheltered, calmer water
- **Laggan Bay** (southeast coast) — long, shallow, sandy
- **Kilnaughton Beach, Port Ellen** — family-friendly, shallow, safe

Either embrace the cold water (it really is good for you!), or bring a wetsuit if you're planning any swimming. The water is cold year-round, and wetsuits make wild swimming more comfortable for longer splashing about. We have guests who swim regularly throughout their stay with and without wetsuits. We're big fans of cold water and relish it.

---

#### Hidden Gem Beaches (H3)

- **Singing Sands** — Beautiful remote beach, worth the walk. The sand squeaks underfoot — kids love it.
- **Claggain Bay** — Secluded, with a lovely coastal walk to reach it. Rarely visited.
- **Port Ellen town beach** — Convenient if you're arriving by the southern ferry or combining with a south coast distillery day.

---

### Section 4: Wildlife & Bird Watching

#### Heading (H2)
Wildlife on Islay

#### Intro Paragraph
Islay is exceptional for wildlife, particularly birds. Let me share what you'll see and where to find it.

---

#### Barnacle Geese (H3)

> **BLOCK REF:** `wildlife-geese` — `renderAs: full`

---

#### Eagles (H3)

Islay has both golden eagles and white-tailed sea eagles — two of Scotland's most magnificent raptors. Keep an eye out for them over moorland, coastal cliffs, and inland hills. Sea eagles are enormous with wingspans up to 8 feet. If you see something huge gliding overhead, it's likely a sea eagle. A good check is "does it look like a barn door?" — their square-ended wing profile is quite distinctive.

We keep binoculars in all our properties, and guests regularly spot eagles from the houses or during coastal walks.

---

#### Seals, Otters & Marine Life (H3)

Common seals and grey seals frequent Loch Indaal and coastal areas. Guests spot seals from our property windows regularly — sometimes they're visible from the breakfast table at Portbahn House. Otters are shyer but present along quiet shorelines. Your best chance is early morning or dusk along the coast. Meandering along the stretch of coast that runs alongside the Bruichladdich to Port Charlotte cycle path is a lovely way to wildlife spot.

Dolphins and porpoises also occasionally visit Loch Indaal. We've had guests see them from Portbahn House and Shorefield's windows — it's rare but magical when it happens. Minke whales and basking sharks can sometimes be seen offshore in summer months.

If you want to explore the coast from the sea, Gus at Islay Boat Tours runs excursions from Port Ellen, and Robert from Jura Boat Tours will take you up Jura's wild coastline.

---

#### Shorefield's Bird Hides: A Unique Asset (H3)

Shorefield has something special: bird hides created by the Jackson family, who built Shorefield and are passionate birders. They planted the trees, created the wetlands, and built the hides specifically for wildlife watching.

The house is stocked with binoculars, bird books, and wildlife guides from the Jacksons' collection as well as sketches and watercolours from their travels. The garden attracts woodland birds, and the loch views offer opportunities to watch waterfowl without leaving the property. Guests who book Shorefield specifically for the bird hides always enjoy it.

If you're a birder or nature lover, Shorefield delivers something you won't find at a typical holiday rental — it's a family home built around a love of wildlife, and we hope that shows in all the detail.

---

#### RSPB Reserves (H3)

- **RSPB Loch Gruinart** — Flagship reserve for geese, waders, raptors
- **RSPB The Oa** — Cliffs, choughs, seabirds, dramatic coastal scenery

Both reserves are free to visit with hides, trails, and visitor information. Bring binoculars (essential for birding), a camera with zoom lens, and warm layers for dawn/dusk watching.

Planning Your Islay Days

---

#### How Many Days Should I Stay? (H3)

- **Minimum:** 2-3 nights allows time for 3-4 distilleries and main beaches
- **Our recommendation:** 5-7 nights for leisurely exploration, a Jura day trip, and proper wildlife watching
- **Whisky-focused trips:** 3-4 full days to tour 5-6 distilleries comfortably without rushing

Remember your first and last days are mostly travel. It's a day's travel to Glasgow (2-hour ferry + 2½-hour drive). Don't rush it — a week gives you five genuine activity days, which is the sweet spot for experiencing Islay properly.

Consider combining with a couple of days on nearby Jura. A dramatically different island with a distinctly "highland" feel with a literary pedigree in George Orwell and thousands of red deer. We have an old cottage, cabin, lodge and shepherd's hut at Bothan Jura Retreat, and would be happy to help you create an Islay-Jura multi-island trip which really gives you quite a different flavour of experience. Get in touch and we'll help if we can.

---

#### Best Time to Visit (H3)

- **April-June:** Sunniest weather, good prices, fewer crowds — this is our favourite season
- **July-August:** Warmest, busiest, school holidays
- **Late May:** Fèis Ìle whisky festival — book accommodation and ferry 6+ months ahead
- **October-March:** Barnacle geese, quieter island, dramatic weather, limited daylight
- **Winter:** Atmospheric, cozy fires in the properties, but some restaurants have reduced hours

---

#### Weather & What to Pack (H3)

Expect wind, rain, and sunshine in the same day — that's Islay. It has a wild west coast maritime climate warmed by the Gulf Stream. Pack waterproof jackets, layers, and good footwear. Summer temperatures are usually around 14-18°C, winter temperatures 6-10°C. Weather changes rapidly, so don't let rain deter you. Some of our guests' favourite beach walks happened in dramatic weather. Embrace it!

Essential packing: waterproofs, warm layers, good walking boots, binoculars (for wildlife), and patience with the weather.

---

#### Mobile Signal & Connectivity (H3)

Mobile signal is generally pretty good, but can be patchy across the island. EE has the best coverage, but don't rely on it for navigation or emergencies. Download offline maps before heading out. WiFi at our accommodations is reliable — use that for planning and communication.

## Embedded FAQs

### Which distilleries should I visit on Islay?

Start with Bruichladdich — 5-minute walk from our properties, unique and innovative whisky range, great tours, and you can walk home. From there, choose based on whisky preferences: heavily peated (Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroaig), balanced (Bowmore, Kilchoman), or gentle/unpeated (Bunnahabhain). Book tours in advance, especially summer and Fèis Ìle. I'm happy to help you plan your distillery itinerary — just ask.

---

### Do I need to book distillery tours ahead?

Yes — advance booking is essential. Summer dates and Fèis Ìle (late May) fill up weeks ahead. Most distilleries limit tour sizes. Check individual distillery websites for availability and book as soon as your ferry/flights are confirmed. Don't leave this to chance.

---

### What are the best beaches on Islay?

**Our hidden gem:** Portbahn Beach (5-minute walk from our properties) — three sheltered bays, rarely crowded, safe swimming, rock pools. **For families:** Port Charlotte Beach and Kilnaughton Beach (Port Ellen) — shallow, safe, sandy. **For dramatic walks:** Machir Bay and Saligo Bay — stunning but dangerous for swimming. Start with Portbahn Beach — guests consistently say it's a highlight.

---

### Where should I eat on Islay?

**Lochindaal Seafood Kitchen** (Port Charlotte) for seafood platters — order 24 hours ahead. **Port Charlotte Hotel** for restaurant dining and an incredible whisky bar. **An Tigh Seinnse** (Portnahaven) for traditional pub food. **Peatzeria** (Bowmore) for creative pizzas. Most guests cook several meals in our kitchens — dining out every night can add up quickly, but is definitely part of the fun. I'm happy to recommend based on what you're looking for.

---

### What wildlife can I see on Islay?

**October-April:** 30,000+ barnacle geese from Greenland at RSPB Loch Gruinart. **Year-round:** Golden eagles, white-tailed sea eagles (8-foot wingspan), seals, otters. **Occasional:** Dolphins in Loch Indaal, minke whales offshore. Shorefield has bird hides created by the owners — grab binoculars and watch from your own hide. Bring binoculars for any wildlife watching.

---

### Is Islay good for families with children?

Yes — Islay is excellent for families. Portbahn Beach is 5 minutes' walk from our properties: three sheltered bays, rock pools at low tide, safe swimming, and you'll almost always have it to yourselves. Port Charlotte Beach and Kilnaughton Bay are also shallow, sandy, and safe for young children. For rainy days, Mactaggart Leisure Centre in Bowmore has a swimming pool. Persabus Pottery does pottery sessions for all ages. Port Charlotte has a playground at Port Mor. Our properties have family-specific features: Portbahn House has a sunken trampoline and swings; Curlew Cottage has a fully enclosed walled garden; Shorefield has bird hides. Let me know your group ages and I can suggest the right itinerary.
