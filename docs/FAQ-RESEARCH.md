## SECTION A: PROPERTY-SPECIFIC FAQs

*Source: Nuance brief + guest reviews*

### Booking & Arrival

**Q: Can I get a late check-out or early arrival?**
Often yes, if no one is booked that day. If someone is arriving at 4pm, we can sometimes arrange late check-out in exchange for putting on the first load of laundry. Just ask when booking.

**Q: How responsive is Pi really?**
Extremely. Communication score: 5.0/5.0 on Airbnb. Pi responds quickly and helps with everything from recommendations to ferry chaos. "Looked after us like family" appears in 30+ reviews.

**Q: What's the Ring doorbell situation at Portbahn?**
External Ring doorbell covers the driveway only—for security and to monitor arrivals. No internal cameras. Some guests note it; most appreciate the security.

### Choosing a Property

**Q: Which property should I choose—Portbahn or Shorefield?**
**Portbahn House** if you want: modern, bright interiors, dishwasher, garden play for children (sunken trampoline), new-build finishes.
**Shorefield** if you value: quirky character, cosy atmosphere, nature focus (bird hides), don't mind "a bit tired" aesthetic.
Both have stunning views, walk to distillery, dog-friendly.

**Q: Is there a dishwasher?**
**Portbahn:** Yes. **Shorefield:** No—this is intentional, part of its character. Guests who need a dishwasher are directed to Portbahn.

**Q: What does "quirky" mean for Shorefield?**
Owners' personality visible: bird books, binoculars, paintings, maps, antiques, furniture from Africa/Asia. Some finishes worn but loved. No dishwasher. Feels like a real family home, not a styled rental. Guests say "like a big hug", "the house has a story".

**Q: What's the WiFi like?**
Both properties have functional WiFi for streaming and light work. Portbahn scores 7.5/10 on Booking.com; Shorefield scores 9.5/10. Not ultra-fast, but Netflix and iPlayer work fine.

## SECTION B: ISLAY & TRAVEL FAQs

*Source: Web research + reviews*

### Getting to Islay

**Q: How do I get to Islay?**
Two options:
1. **Ferry:** CalMac from Kennacraig to Port Ellen or Port Askaig (~2 hours). Book vehicles 12 weeks in advance.
2. **Air:** Loganair from Glasgow to Islay Airport (~45 mins). Two flights daily (one on weekends).

**Q: How far in advance should I book the ferry?**
Book 12 weeks ahead for vehicles. Ferries fill quickly, especially summer and Fèis Ìle (whisky festival, late May). Foot passengers have more flexibility but should still pre-book.

**Q: What if my ferry is cancelled?**
Contact Pi immediately—we've helped guests navigate CalMac disruptions dozens of times. CalMac will usually contact you; their helpline is 0800 066 5000. Sign up for CalMac text alerts (text "calmac subscribe 09" to 60030). Get travel insurance—seriously.

**Q: Why do ferries get cancelled?**
Weather (wind gusts 40-45mph+), mechanical issues (ageing fleet), industrial action. Winter months worse. When amber alert issued, cancellations more likely. It's part of island life—locals shrug it off.

**Q: How long is the journey from Glasgow?**
Minimum 5+ hours: 3 hours driving to Kennacraig + 2.5 hour ferry. Unless you catch morning ferries, you're arriving afternoon at earliest. First day is effectively a travel day.

### Getting Around

**Q: Do I need a car on Islay?**
Recommended. Bus services exist but are limited and stop in evening. Taxis should be booked ahead. Car rental available from Islay Car Hire at the airport—book in advance.

**Q: What's the driving like?**
Roads often winding and single-track. Use passing places for overtaking and two-way traffic. Expect the "Islay wave"—locals wave at passing cars, reciprocate!

**Q: Can I drink on distillery tours if I'm driving?**
Scotland's drink-drive limit is effectively zero. Distilleries give drivers a "driver's dram" to take away and enjoy at accommodation. Designate a driver for touring days.

**Q: Can I walk from the properties to restaurants?**
Port Charlotte is 40-min scenic coastal walk (or 5-min drive). Bruichladdich Distillery is 10 mins on foot. For evening meals, most guests drive.

### How Long to Stay

**Q: How many days should I spend on Islay?**
- **Minimum:** 2-3 days (see highlights, 3-4 distilleries)
- **Recommended:** 5-7 days (leisurely exploration, Jura day trip, wildlife, beaches)
- **Whisky-focused:** 3-4 full days to visit 5-6 distilleries without rushing

Remember: first day is mostly travel. Factor in a Jura day trip if interested.

**Q: When is the best time to visit?**
- **April-June:** Sunniest, good prices, fewer crowds
- **July-August:** Warmest, busiest, school holidays
- **Late May:** Fèis Ìle whisky festival (book far ahead!)
- **October-April:** Barnacle geese (30,000+ birds), quieter, dramatic weather
- **Winter:** Avoid unless prepared for wind/rain and limited daylight

### Distilleries

**Q: How many distilleries are on Islay?**
Nine working distilleries: Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroaig (Port Ellen trio), Bowmore, Bruichladdich, Kilchoman, Bunnahabhain, Ardnahoe, Caol Ila.

**Q: Which distilleries can I walk to from the properties?**
Bruichladdich is 10 minutes on foot. Also produces The Botanist gin. Other distilleries require driving.

**Q: Do I need to book distillery tours?**
Yes—book in advance. Some close certain days or limit tours. Check websites. Most stop tours by 4pm.

**Q: How many distilleries per day is realistic?**
Two per day is comfortable. More gets overwhelming and tiring. Plan travel time between distilleries (some are 45+ mins apart).

### Beaches & Swimming

**Q: Is there a beach nearby?**
**Portbahn Beach** is 5-min walk via war memorial path—a hidden gem. **Port Charlotte Beach** (5-min drive) is sandy and sheltered, great for families.

**Q: Where is it safe to swim on Islay?**
**Safe:** Loch Indaal (sheltered), Port Charlotte beaches, Kilnaughton Beach (Port Ellen—shallow, sandy), Laggan Bay, Loch Gruinart.
**DANGEROUS:** West coast beaches (Machir Bay, Saligo Bay)—strong currents, locals call them "drowning beaches". Not for swimming.

**Q: Do I need a wetsuit?**
Recommended for wild swimming year-round. Water is cold. Loch Indaal is calmer than Atlantic beaches.

### Food & Eating Out

**Q: Where do I get groceries?**
- **Aileen's mini-market, Bruichladdich** (10-min walk): coffee, bacon rolls, basics, post office—highly recommended by guests
- **Bowmore Co-op** (15-min drive): full supermarket
- **Bowmore:** butcher, bakery, fresh fish van

**Q: Where can I eat out?**
- **Lochindaal Seafood Kitchen, Port Charlotte:** Seafood platters (order 24hrs ahead)
- **Port Charlotte Hotel:** Restaurant + excellent whisky bar
- **An Tigh Seinnse, Portnahaven:** Village pub, local charm, book ahead
- **Peatzeria, Bowmore:** Pizza with local toppings (lobster, scallops)
- **Bowmore:** Takeaway options (Chinese, Indian, fish & chips)

Note: Dining on Islay isn't cheap. Most guests enjoy cooking in well-equipped cottage kitchens.

### Weather & Packing

**Q: What should I pack for Islay?**
- **Essential:** Waterproof jacket with hood (windproof, breathable), layers
- **Recommended:** Waterproof trousers, hiking boots, wool hat, gloves
- **Don't bring:** Umbrella (wind destroys them), jeans (terrible when wet)

Weather changes rapidly. Expect wind, rain, and sunshine in same day. Dress in layers.

**Q: What's the weather like?**
Cool and windy. Temperatures 9-12°C typical. High chance of rain (80%+). Atlantic winds year-round. Winter has shorter days, stronger winds. Summer has long daylight (sunrise 5am—black-out blinds provided at properties).

### Connectivity

**Q: Is there mobile phone signal?**
Patchy. EE generally best coverage. Black spots common (Port Askaig notorious). Don't rely on mobile for navigation—download offline maps. WiFi at accommodations often more reliable than mobile data.

**Q: Can I stream Netflix / work remotely?**
Yes—WiFi at both properties handles streaming. Shorefield scores 9.5/10, Portbahn 7.5/10 on Booking.com. Not ultra-fast but functional. Don't plan video-heavy work calls.

### Wildlife
