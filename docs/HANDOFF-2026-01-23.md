# Session Handoff - 2026-01-23

## What Was Completed This Session

### 1. AI Search Playbook Skill Setup
- Installed globally at `~/.claude/skills/ai-search-playbook/`
- Full playbook at `docs/playbook-v1.3.1/`
- Available to all Claude Code projects

### 2. Property Page Optimised to 10/10
**Commits:**
- `99b80f0` - feat: enhance schema.org with reviews, ratings, availability
- `2364dd1` - refactor: optimise property page for AI search playbook

**Changes made:**
- Removed duplicate "What Makes X Special?" section
- Removed debug preview section with raw JSON
- Removed dev placeholder text (sections now only render if content exists)
- Reordered sections to playbook conversational flow
- All sections conditional: no Sanity content = no frontend render

**Section order now:**
Overview → Sleeping → Facilities → Outdoor → Included → Common Questions → Guest Experience → Reviews → Google Reviews → Location → Getting Here → Pet Policy → House Rules → Pricing → Booking → Gallery → Other Properties

### 3. Working Notes Established
- `docs/WORKING-NOTES.md` - Central context file for session continuity
- `docs/README.md` - Updated to point to working notes first
- Commit: `9d94f14`

## Next Task: Other Pages Workflow

**Goal:** Apply same 10/10 standard to remaining site pages

**Steps:**
1. **Scrape live site** - Fetch portbahnislay.co.uk pages (About, Contact, FAQ, Islay Guides, etc.)
2. **Aggregate content** - Combine with:
   - `docs/content/PBI-NUANCE-BRIEF-ENHANCED.md`
   - `docs/content/PB-Reviews-Working.md`
   - `docs/content/SHF-Reviews-Working.md`
3. **Content analysis** - Identify new pages needed, gaps, pages to merge/split
4. **Apply playbook** - Restructure per entity-first, passage-extractable, conversational flow
5. **Update Sanity schema** - Add/modify types (page, guide, faq, etc.)
6. **Import content** - Create Sanity documents

---

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| No content = no section | Clean UX, no empty blocks or placeholders for users |
| Placeholder text in Sanity only | Helps editors, never shown on frontend |
| Playbook conversational flow | Optimised for AI retrieval and user journey |
| Tabs/accordions OK for details | Hidden content is indexed but less likely to be cited - keep entity-defining content visible |

---

## UI/UX Note (Deferred to UI Phase)

Property pages are long - need visual restructuring to avoid "bullet soup". Recommended pattern documented in `docs/WORKING-NOTES.md`:
- Keep entity-defining content visible (overview, questions, reviews summary, pricing)
- Tab/collapse supporting details (facilities, full rules, directions)
- "Fixed spine, flexible skin" principle

---

## Files to Read First

1. `docs/WORKING-NOTES.md` - Current status and decisions
2. `docs/content/PBI-NUANCE-BRIEF-ENHANCED.md` - Site nuance and content strategy
3. `~/.claude/skills/ai-search-playbook/SKILL.md` - AI search optimisation guidelines
