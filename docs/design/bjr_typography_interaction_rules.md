# 1. Serif vs Mono Usage Rules

## 1.1 Serif = The Seasons (Headlines & Typographic Moments Only)
**Allowed:**
- H1–H3
- Hero titles
- Section openers
- Large pull quotes
- Poetic/expressive standalone lines
- Special typographic "moments" that feel like page headers

**Prohibited:**
- Body copy
- Lists
- Buttons
- UI labels
- Metadata
- Captions
- Navigation links
- Inline links
- Small headings (H4–H6)

**Rationale:** Serif = emotion, atmosphere, poetry. Reserved for maximum impact.

---

## 1.2 Mono = IBM Plex Mono (Body, Metadata, Structure)
**Mandatory mono usage:**
- All body copy
- All lists
- All metadata
- All captions
- All UI labels
- All inline links
- Buttons
- Navigation links
- H4–H6
- Numbered lists (1., 2., 3.)
- Catalogue-number lists (01, 02…)

**Optional mono usage:**
- Smaller pull quotes
- Metadata headers
- Catalogue aesthetic details

**Rationale:** Mono = archival, structured, contemporary, precise.

---

## 1.3 Mixed Serif + Mono Rules
- Large = serif
- Small = mono
- Poetic moments = serif
- Data-driven blocks = mono
- Quotes:
  - Large expressive quotes → serif
  - Small attribution → mono

# 2. Interaction & Hover Behaviour Rules

## 2.1 Inline Body Text Links
- **Default:** dotted underline
- **Hover:** solid underline
- Colour: Charcoal (light background) / Stone (dark background)
- No bolding
- No animation
- No colour shift

**Purpose:** Editorial, literary, refined, accessible.

---

## 2.2 Footer Links
- Same behaviour as inline links (dotted → solid)
- Quiet, book‑like link behaviour.

---

## 2.3 Navigation Links (Header / Overlay Menu)
- No underline by default
- Hover: **solid underline**
- Colour stays constant
- Serif for main nav items
- Mono for secondary/sublabels

---

## 2.4 Buttons (Text-Only)
- Mono text
- No underline by default
- Hover: **solid underline**
- Optional: subtle letter‑spacing increase (+1%)
- No movement, no animations
- No borders or fills

---

## 2.5 Card Titles (Accommodation, Guides, etc.)
- Default: no underline
- Hover: **solid underline**
- Image remains static

---

## 2.6 Image Hover Behaviour
- **No zoom**
- **No fade**
- **No dim**
- **No shift**
- **No movement**

**Purpose:** Maintain gallery‑catalogue feel.

---

## 2.7 Accent Behaviour
- Rust → primary accent for optional hover underlines
- Sea Blue → secondary (used rarely)
- Accents never used as background fills
- Avoid colour flood or heavy contrast moments

---

## 2.8 Overlay Menu Behaviour
- Fade‑in / fade‑out only
- No sliding or directional motion
- Keeps the aesthetic calm, slow, and book‑like

---

## 2.9 Scroll Behaviour
- No scroll‑trigger animations
- No parallax
- Section transitions defined only by whitespace

---

# 3. Notes
- These rules are approved as v1.
- Revisions may occur once Figma layouts and Studio templates are evaluated.
- All typography and interaction choices align with the BJR aesthetic: minimal, literary, calm, archival.
