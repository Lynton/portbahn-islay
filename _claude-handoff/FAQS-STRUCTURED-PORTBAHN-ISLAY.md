Bruichladdich on the west coast makes an excellent base - central location means all ten distilleries, best beaches, and villages are within 45 minutes. Our three properties here offer 5-minute walks to both Bruichladdich Distillery and Portbahn Beach, with Port Charlotte village 5 minutes away.

Minimum 3 nights for a meaningful visit (one distillery day, one beach/wildlife day, one village/relaxation day). We recommend 5-7 nights - our guests who book a week consistently say they wish they'd stayed longer. Treat first and last days as travel days.

**Category:** Accommodation & Planning

---

### When is the best time to visit Islay?
Late May for Fèis Ìle whisky festival (book 6+ months ahead). Summer (June-August) for weather and long daylight. October-April for barnacle geese spectacle at Loch Gruinart. Winter is quieter, wetter, but atmospheric - and ferries are less likely to be fully booked.

**Category:** Accommodation & Planning

### Is Jura worth visiting?
If you want genuine remoteness - yes. One road, one hotel, one pub, 6,000+ red deer to ~200 people. It makes Islay feel busy. Perfect for dramatic landscapes, wildlife, and proper escape. Day trip works, but longer stays let you reach Barnhill (where Orwell wrote 1984) and Corryvreckan whirlpool.
