# Portbahn Islay & Bothán Jura Retreat - Tone of Voice Skill
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-01-23
**Purpose:** Editorial voice guide for all content creation across PBI and BJR properties

---

## Core Voice Principles

### **Personal, Simple, Clear, Evocative**

**Not:** Corporate accommodation copy
**But:** How Pi and Lynton would naturally describe their homes

**Not:** "The property features..."
**But:** "Our..."

**Not:** "Guests will find..."
**But:** "You'll discover..." or "We've included..."

---

## The Voice DNA

### **1. PERSONAL & DIRECT**

**We are:**
- Pi and Lynton managing three family homes (not purpose-built AirBnBs)
- Hosts who care deeply because these are real homes with real stories
- Present and involved (not absent landlords)

**The homes:**
- **Portbahn House:** Our own family home (Pi and Lynton's)
- **Shorefield:** The Jackson family's home—they built it, planted the trees, created the wetlands and bird hides, filled it with their paintings, books, and curios from travels
- **Curlew Cottage:** Allan's family retreat for years, now opened to guests—filled with his family's personal effects and "holiday things"

**Critical distinction:** NOT purpose-created modern/neutral/soulless AirBnB businesses. These are family homes with personal touches, run by us with that in mind.

**Voice characteristics:**
- First person: "I'm Pi", "we manage", "our friend's home"
- Direct address: "you'll find", "your holiday", "contact me"
- Named ownership: "Pi handles bookings", "the Jacksons built Shorefield", "Allan's retreat"

**Examples from live content:**
✅ "our neighbouring properties"
✅ "We recommend booking travel insurance"
✅ "contact us for local advice"

**Upgraded voice (for guide pages):**
✅ "I'm Pi, and I've been welcoming guests to Islay since 2017"
✅ "Contact me immediately if your ferry is disrupted"
✅ "One of my guests recently said..."

---

### **2. QUIRKY / ECCENTRIC / ECLECTIC** (Without Being Weird)

**Islay (PBI):** Family homes with personality
**Jura (BJR):** A passion project, our DNA, built with hard work

**Voice characteristics:**
- Personality visible: "Shorefield: bird books, world travel mementos"
- Owner lens: "our favourite walks", not "Jura walks"
- Honest character: "a bit tired, a lot loved", "quirky charm"
- Real details: "sunken trampoline", "bird hides we created"

**What this means in practice:**

❌ Generic: "The accommodation includes books and games"
✅ Personal: "Rainy day? Shorefield has our favourite board games and a cosy fire"

❌ Generic: "The property has gardens"
✅ Personal: "Behind Shorefield are bird hides we created—grab binoculars and watch from your own hide"

❌ Generic: "Walking trails available"
✅ Personal: "Our favourite walk loops past Jura Distillery and returns via the old drovers' track"

---

### **3. HONEST TRANSPARENCY**

**We don't hide imperfections—we frame them authentically**

**Live examples from nuance brief:**
✅ "Shorefield isn't for everyone... well-loved home, a little tired, filled with charm and character"
✅ "We point guests who prefer modern finishes to Portbahn"
✅ "For us, cleanliness is a very high priority" (despite worn aesthetic)

**Voice characteristics:**
- Name tradeoffs: "No dishwasher at Shorefield—it's part of its character"
- Set expectations: "Small twin room—fine for kids, tight for adults"
- Offer alternatives: "If you need a dishwasher, Portbahn has one"
- Frame positively: "Not a carefully choreographed rental—it's a family home. And that's what it is."

**Pattern:**
1. State the fact (imperfection)
2. Contextualize (why it's this way)
3. Help guest self-select (who it's for / not for)

---

### **4. WARM & REASSURING** (Especially in Crisis)

**Pi's legendary ferry support:**
✅ "I've got your back"
✅ "Contact me immediately—I've done this dozens of times"
✅ "We've never had a booking collapse due to CalMac"

**Voice characteristics:**
- Confidence without arrogance: "I've helped dozens of guests navigate this"
- Practical reassurance: "There's always a solution"
- Emotional support: "Pi looked after us like family" (guest quote we reinforce)

**Crisis voice pattern:**
1. Acknowledge the problem ("Ferry cancellations happen")
2. Show experience ("I've helped dozens of guests")
3. Give clear action ("Contact me immediately")
4. Reassure outcome ("We've never had a booking collapse")

---

### **5. EVOCATIVE WITHOUT BEING FLOWERY**

**We paint pictures, but stay grounded**

**Live examples:**
✅ "The coastal location provides immediate access to Portbahn Beach, one of Islay's hidden gems with three sheltered bays"
✅ "A scenic 10-minute walk along the coastal cycle path connects our properties directly to the distillery gates"
✅ "Bruichladdich's central west coast location makes it an ideal base for experiencing the very best of island life"

**Voice characteristics:**
- Sensory details: "sheltered bays", "coastal cycle path", "cosy fire"
- Place-making: "Portbahn Beach" (named, not "the nearby beach")
- Atmosphere: "tranquil beauty", "dramatic coastal landscapes"
- **But never:** Purple prose, over-adjectives, "once in a lifetime", "unforgettable"

**Pattern:**
- One evocative phrase per paragraph maximum
- Ground it in practical details ("10-minute walk", "three sheltered bays")
- Use guest language: "hidden gem", "home from home"

---

## Sentence Structure

### **Mix of lengths, skewing shorter**

**Short for clarity:**
✅ "Book 12 weeks ahead."
✅ "It's part of island life."
✅ "We've got your back."

**Medium for information:**
✅ "The ferry crossing takes 2 hours and offers stunning views across the Sound of Islay."
✅ "Portbahn House is our largest modern home sleeping 8, ideal for whisky enthusiasts and families."

**Avoid:**
❌ Long, flowing sentences with multiple clauses that pack in too much information and lose clarity

**Exception:** One longer sentence per section for rhythm variation is fine.

---

## Word Choices

### **Scottish / Islay Authenticity**

**Use naturally:**
✅ "CalMac ferry chaos" (not "disruptions")
✅ "The Islay wave" (locals waving at passing cars)
✅ "Fèis Ìle" (whisky festival—use Gaelic)
✅ "Paps of Jura" (mountain range)
✅ "Loch Indaal" (always "loch", never "lake")
✅ "The Botanist gin" (distillery product)

**Avoid:**
❌ Generic UK terms when Scottish term exists
❌ Anglicizing Gaelic place names

### **Guest Language (From 600+ Reviews)**

**Repeat verbatim:**
✅ "Home from home" (most common phrase)
✅ "Better than the pictures" (repeated 10+ times)
✅ "Felt like home from the minute we stepped in"
✅ "Looked after us like family"
✅ "Like a big hug" (Shorefield specifically)
✅ "The house has a story"

**Why:** This is how guests describe us—reinforcing their language = recognition + trust.

### **Our Vocabulary**

**Prefer:** Personal, specific, grounded
✅ "Our properties" / "our homes"
✅ "Pi and Lynton"
✅ "Bruichladdich" (never "the village")
✅ "Portbahn Beach" (name it, own it)
✅ "Sunken trampoline" (specific detail)
✅ "Bird hides we created"

**Avoid:** Corporate, generic, vague
❌ "The accommodation"
❌ "The management"
❌ "The local area"
❌ "Nearby beach"
❌ "Garden play equipment"
❌ "Wildlife viewing areas"

## Voice Shifts by Context

### **Islay (PBI) vs Jura (BJR)**

**Islay voice:**
- Three family homes: ours + friends' homes we manage
- **Portbahn House:** Our own family home we're now sharing
- **Shorefield:** The Jacksons' family home—their books, art, bird hides, personality everywhere
- **Curlew Cottage:** Allan's family retreat—his holiday home, personal effects, now available to guests
- Practical, grounded, warm, honest about each home's character
- **Tone:** "These are real family homes, not rentals—and we manage them with that care"

**Jura voice:**
- A passion we built from scratch
- Our DNA, our vision, hard work made real
- The place WE would want to reset and recharge
- **Tone:** "We built the place we'd want to go"

**Distinction:**
- **PBI:** Stewards of three distinct family homes (ours + friends'), each with its own story
- **BJR:** Creators sharing their vision

Both are personal, but BJR leans "passion project we created" while PBI leans "family homes we're honored to share—ours and our friends'."

## Content Type Variations

### **Guide Pages (Getting Here, Explore)**

**Voice:** Pi speaking directly
**Pattern:**
- Open first-person: "I'm Pi, and..."
- Practical information in active voice
- Trust signals: "I've helped dozens of guests"
- Warm reassurance: "I've got your back"

**Example:**
✅ "I'm Pi, and I've been welcoming guests to Islay since 2017. Let me walk you through getting here smoothly—especially when CalMac throws a curveball."

### **Property Pages**

**Voice:** "We" / "Our"
**Pattern:**
- Descriptive but personal
- Honest about character/quirks
- Help guests self-select
- Ground evocative language in specifics

**Example:**
✅ "Shorefield is our eco-house powered by renewables—a quirky, well-loved family home with bird hides, world travel mementos, and a cosy fire. Not modern perfection, but full of character and charm."

### **About Us Page**

**Voice:** Pi & Lynton directly
**Pattern:**
- "We're Pi and Lynton..."
- Why we do this (passion, connection to islands)
- Real homes philosophy—NOT purpose-built AirBnBs
- Personal journey (Islay → Jura)
- Each home's story (ours, the Jacksons', Allan's)

**Example:**
✅ "We're Pi and Lynton, and we've been hosting guests on Islay since 2017. We manage three family homes—each one with its own story. Portbahn House was our family home for years. Shorefield is the Jacksons' creation—they built it, planted every tree, created the bird hides, and filled it with paintings and books from their travels. Curlew Cottage is Allan's family retreat that he's now opening to guests. These aren't soulless purpose-built AirBnBs—they're real family homes with personality, and we manage them with that care. On Jura, we built Bothán Jura Retreat from scratch—the kind of place we'd want to escape to ourselves."

### **Crisis Communication (Ferry Chaos)**

**Voice:** Confident, reassuring, actionable
**Pattern:**
1. Acknowledge ("It happens")
2. Show experience ("I've done this dozens of times")
3. Clear action ("Contact me immediately")
4. Reassure ("There's always a solution")

**Example:**
✅ "Ferry cancelled? Contact me immediately at [number]. I've helped dozens of guests navigate CalMac disruptions—we'll figure out the next sailing, adjust your check-in, or find a backup plan. In 8+ years, we've never had a booking collapse. There's always a solution."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### **❌ Too Generic**
"The properties offer a comfortable base for exploring the island"
✅ **Fix:** "Our homes are your base—walk to Bruichladdich Distillery in 10 minutes, then return to cosy fires and sea views"

### **❌ Too Corporate**
"Guests will find all amenities provided"
✅ **Fix:** "We've stocked the kitchen with everything you'll need—plus honesty boxes for tea, coffee, and logs"

### **❌ Over-Sold / Hyperbolic**
"An unforgettable once-in-a-lifetime experience"
✅ **Fix:** "The sunrise over Loch Indaal from the king bedroom is something guests mention in nearly every review"

### **❌ Hiding Imperfections**
[No mention of worn carpets at Shorefield]
✅ **Fix:** "Shorefield is a bit tired in places—carpets need refreshing—but guests who book here value character over modern finishes. It's a well-loved family home, not a styled rental."

### **❌ Anonymous Third Person**
"The host provides excellent support"
✅ **Fix:** "Pi responds within hours—guests say I'm legendary at helping with ferry chaos"

### **❌ Vague Location References**
"Near local attractions"
✅ **Fix:** "10-minute walk to Bruichladdich Distillery along the coastal cycle path"

## Before/After Examples

### **Example 1: Property Description**

❌ **Before (Generic):**
"Portbahn House is a modern self-catering property that sleeps 8 guests. The property features a fully equipped kitchen, comfortable bedrooms, and a private garden. Located near local amenities and attractions."

✅ **After (Personal, Clear, Evocative):**
"Portbahn House is our largest home—a modern, bright space sleeping 8, ideal for families and whisky groups. The open-plan kitchen flows to living areas where you can watch the sunrise over Loch Indaal. Kids love the sunken trampoline in the secure garden. You're a 10-minute walk from Bruichladdich Distillery along the coastal cycle path—tour the distillery, then walk home for dinner."

**Changes:**
- "Our largest home" (personal ownership)
- "Modern, bright" (specific character)
- "Sunrise over Loch Indaal" (evocative + specific)
- "Kids love the sunken trampoline" (real detail, not "play equipment")
- "10-minute walk... walk home for dinner" (practical detail + experience)

---

### **Example 2: Ferry Guide**

❌ **Before (Generic):**
"Ferry services to Islay operate from Kennacraig. Advance booking is recommended. Services may be disrupted by weather."

✅ **After (Personal, Reassuring, Clear):**
"I'm Pi, and I've been helping guests get to Islay since 2017. Book your CalMac ferry 12 weeks ahead—seriously, they fill fast. If your ferry gets cancelled (it happens—weather, mechanical issues), contact me immediately. I've navigated this with dozens of guests. We hold a 5.0/5 communication rating, and 30+ reviews mention our ferry crisis support. There's always a solution."

**Changes:**
- "I'm Pi" (personal introduction)
- "12 weeks ahead—seriously" (direct, conversational)
- "If your ferry gets cancelled (it happens...)" (reassuring, honest)
- "Contact me immediately" (actionable, supportive)
- "5.0/5 communication rating" (trust signal)
- "There's always a solution" (reassuring conclusion)

---

### **Example 3: Honest Friction**

❌ **Before (Hiding):**
[No mention of Shorefield's worn finishes]

✅ **After (Transparent):**
"Shorefield isn't for everyone. It's a well-loved family home—a bit tired in places, with worn carpets and furniture that's seen better days. But guests who book here aren't looking for modern perfection. They want character, coziness, and a house that feels like a favourite aunt's place. If you need a dishwasher or prefer new-build finishes, Portbahn House is your match. But if you value quirky charm and cosy fires over polish, Shorefield delivers."

**Changes:**
- "Shorefield isn't for everyone" (honest opening)
- "A bit tired... worn carpets" (specific imperfections named)
- "Well-loved family home" (positive framing)
- "Favourite aunt's place" (guest language, evocative)
- "If you need a dishwasher..." (help guests self-select)
- "Portbahn House is your match" (alternative offered)

## Implementation Notes

### **For Content Creators:**

1. **Read this skill before every writing session**
2. **Check live homepage content** (`homepage-current.json`) for current voice baseline
3. **Review nuance brief** for Pi's direct quotes and transparency examples
4. **Use guest language** from reviews verbatim where appropriate
5. **Ask:** "Would Pi actually say this?" If no, revise.

### **For Quality Review:**

1. Read content aloud—does it sound human?
2. Check personal pronouns—"we/our/I" vs "the property/the host"
3. Count evocative phrases—max one per paragraph
4. Verify specifics—"10-minute walk" not "nearby"
5. Test transparency—are imperfections named honestly?
