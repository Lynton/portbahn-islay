## Content Sections

### Section 1: About Us — Pi & Lynton

#### Heading (H2)
Welcome to Portbahn Islay

#### Content

We're Pi and Lynton, and we've been welcoming guests to Islay since 2017. We manage three family homes in Bruichladdich—each one with its own story, each one a real home with personality, not a purpose-built rental. Over 600 guests have stayed with us across 8 years, and we hold a 4.97/5 average rating. We're Superhosts on Airbnb, and guests consistently mention our legendary support—especially when CalMac throws ferry chaos into your travel plans.

These properties matter to us. Portbahn House was our family home for years. Shorefield is the Jacksons' creation—they built it, planted every tree, created the bird hides, and filled it with their art and books. Curlew Cottage is Allan's family retreat, opened to guests with all its cozy authenticity intact. We manage these homes the way we'd want our own managed: with care, attention, and a genuine interest in making your Islay stay brilliant.

If you're looking for soulless modern AirBnBs, we're not your match. But if you want real homes with character, local knowledge, and hosts who actually care? Welcome home.

### Section 2: Our Three Homes

#### Heading (H2)
Three Distinctive Family Homes

#### Portbahn House (H3)

**Our family home—modern comfort for 8 guests**

Portbahn House is our largest property and was our family home for years. Modern, bright, and comfortable, it sleeps 8 guests across 4 bedrooms. The open-plan kitchen and living areas flow together, with sea views across Loch Indaal from the king bedroom. Kids love the secure garden with its sunken trampoline and swings.

You're a 10-minute walk from Bruichladdich Distillery along the coastal cycle path—tour the distillery, then walk home for dinner. Portbahn Beach (one of Islay's hidden gems) is 5 minutes via the war memorial path. This is the home for families, whisky groups, and anyone who values modern finishes and space.

---

#### Shorefield (H3)

**The Jacksons' eco-house—bird hides, renewables, character**

Shorefield is the Jacksons' creation, and their personality is everywhere. They built this eco-house powered by wind and solar, planted every tree, created the wetlands and bird hides, and filled the house with paintings, books, and curios from their travels. This is a quirky, well-loved family home—a bit tired in places (carpets need refreshing), but full of charm and character.

The bird hides they created are stocked with binoculars and guides from their collection. The house has no dishwasher (it's part of its character), but guests who book Shorefield aren't looking for modern perfection—they want coziness, personality, and a house that feels like a favourite aunt's place. One guest called it *"like a big hug."*

If you prefer new-build finishes, Portbahn House is your match. But if you value quirky charm over polish, Shorefield delivers.

#### Curlew Cottage (H3)

**Allan's family retreat—cozy, authentic, peaceful**

Curlew Cottage is Allan's family retreat, and he's now opening it to guests. It's filled with his family's personal effects and "holiday things"—books, games, comfortable furniture, everything you'd want for a proper Islay break. The walled garden is safe and private, and the property has its own access road for peace and quiet.

This is a genuine family home, not a styled rental. It sleeps 6 guests across 3 bedrooms and offers that cozy, unpretentious authenticity that guests describe as *"home from home."* If you're looking for a safe, quiet retreat away from the main road, Curlew Cottage is ideal for families.

### Section 4: Why Stay in Bruichladdich

#### Heading (H2)
Why We Love Bruichladdich

#### Perfect Location (H3)

Bruichladdich sits on the western shore of Loch Indaal on the Rhinns of Islay, perfectly positioned for exploring everything the island offers. You're a scenic 10-minute walk to Bruichladdich Distillery along the coastal cycle path—tour the distillery, sample world-renowned whisky and The Botanist gin, then walk home.

The coastal location gives immediate access to Portbahn Beach—one of Islay's hidden gems with three sheltered bays perfect for wild swimming, rock pooling, and coastal walks. Port Charlotte (5 minutes by car or 45 minutes on foot) offers family-friendly restaurants, traditional pubs, local shops, and the fascinating Islay Museum.

---

#### From Here, Everything's Reachable (H3)

From Bruichladdich, all nine of Islay's whisky distilleries are within easy reach. The island's renowned beaches—Machir Bay to Saligo Bay—offer miles of golden sand and dramatic Atlantic surf. RSPB nature reserves provide exceptional bird watching, with over 30,000 barnacle geese arriving each winter from Greenland. The countryside is perfect for hiking and wildlife spotting, from golden eagles to seals.

Bruichladdich's central west coast location makes it an ideal base for experiencing the very best of island life on Islay.

### Section 5: Getting to Islay

#### Heading (H2)
How to Get Here

#### Content

The Isle of Islay is accessible by **CalMac ferry** from Kennacraig on the Kintyre Peninsula (2-hour crossing to Port Ellen or Port Askaig) or by **Loganair flight** from Glasgow (40-minute flight to Islay Airport). Vehicle ferry reservations are essential and should be booked 12 weeks in advance—seriously, they fill fast.

Ferry cancellations happen due to weather or mechanical issues, especially in winter. When they do, contact me immediately. I've helped dozens of guests navigate CalMac disruptions since 2017, and we hold a 5.0/5 communication rating. There's always a solution.

[Full Getting Here Guide →](/getting-here) — including ferry booking strategies, what to expect on the crossing, and exactly what to do if your ferry is cancelled.
