**Search volume:** 170/month (kennacraig ferry)

#### Q4: Can you fly to Islay from Glasgow?
**Search volume:** 210/month
**Answer:** Yes, Loganair operates daily flights taking 25 minutes. Two flights typically run daily (one on weekends). Islay Airport is 30 minutes' drive from Bruichladdich. Flights are weather-dependent - low cloud prevents landing.

### 2. EXPLORE ISLAY PAGE (`/explore-islay`)

**Section 1:** "Planning Your Visit" (add after distilleries section)
**Count:** 5 questions

#### Q1: What is Islay famous for?
**Search volume:** Low but foundational
**Answer:** Islay is renowned for peaty, smoky single malt whiskies - it has ten working distilleries including Ardbeg, Laphroaig and Bruichladdich. The island also attracts birdwatchers for its 30,000+ barnacle geese arriving each October from Greenland.

#### Q2: What is Islay whisky?
**Search volume:** 20/month
**Answer:** Islay whisky is typically heavily peated single malt Scotch with smoky, maritime character - though not all Islay distilleries make peated whisky. Bruichladdich produces everything from unpeated Laddie to Octomore, the world's peatiest whisky. [Distillery guide →](#distilleries)

#### Q3: How many distilleries are on Islay?
**Search volume:** Implied in "why does islay have so many distilleries"
**Answer:** Ten working distilleries: Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroaig, Bowmore, Bruichladdich, Kilchoman, Bunnahabhain, Caol Ila, Ardnahoe, and the newly reopened Port Ellen (2024). You're a 5-minute walk from Bruichladdich from our properties.

#### Q4: Is Islay good for families?
**Search volume:** "islay for kids" "islay with kids"
**Answer:** Yes - safe beaches with rock pools, wildlife on your doorstep, space to roam freely. Our kids have grown up here. Portbahn Beach (5-minute walk) is perfect for children, and there's swimming pool, pottery painting and playgrounds for rainy days. [Family guide →](#families)

#### Q5: What's the weather like on Islay?
**Search volume:** 480/month ("weather for islay")
**Answer:** Changeable! Mild year-round (rarely below freezing or above 20°C) but expect four seasons in one day. Atlantic weather rolls in fast - pack layers, waterproofs, and embrace it. Summer averages 12-17°C, winter 4-8°C.

#### Q7: Can you get around Islay without a car?
**Search volume:** 10/month
**Answer:** Challenging. Public buses run limited routes between main villages. Taxis and bike hire are available, but distances are significant and distilleries are spread out. A car is strongly recommended for exploring properly - our guests almost always bring vehicles on the ferry.

### 3. HOMEPAGE

**Section:** "Common Questions About Staying With Us" (add after trust signals, before property showcase)
**Count:** 4 questions
**Purpose:** Address accommodation search queries

#### Q1: Where should I stay on Islay?
**Search volume:** 1,900/month (TOP QUERY!)
**Answer:** Bruichladdich on the west coast makes an excellent base - central location means all ten distilleries, best beaches, and villages are within 45 minutes. Our three properties here offer 5-minute walks to both Bruichladdich Distillery and Portbahn Beach, with Port Charlotte village 5 minutes away.

#### Q2: How many days do I need on Islay?
**Search volume:** Implied in "islay how many days"
**Answer:** Minimum 3 nights for a meaningful visit (one distillery day, one beach/wildlife day, one village/relaxation day). We recommend 5-7 nights - our guests who book a week consistently say they wish they'd stayed longer. Treat first and last days as travel days.

#### Q3: When is the best time to visit Islay?
**Search volume:** Implied seasonal questions
**Answer:** Late May for Fèis Ìle whisky festival (book 6+ months ahead). Summer (June-August) for weather and long daylight. October-April for barnacle geese spectacle at Loch Gruinart. Winter is quieter, wetter, but atmospheric - and ferries are less likely to be fully booked.

#### Q4: Do you help with ferry disruptions?
**Search volume:** Related to ferry anxiety
**Answer:** Absolutely - we hold a 5.0/5 communication rating and 30+ reviews specifically mention our ferry crisis support. In 8+ years of hosting 600+ guests, we've never had a booking completely collapse. Contact us immediately if CalMac disrupts your crossing. [Ferry support →](#ferry-support)

---

##### Q2: What makes Shorefield different from your other properties?
**Answer:** Shorefield is quirky and full of character - an eco-house with wind and solar power, filled with the Jacksons' art, books and curios from their travels. It's well-worn and well-loved rather than polished modern. If you value personality over perfection, you'll love it here.

##### Q3: Is Shorefield good for children?

### 5. JURA PAGE (`/jura`)

**Section:** "Visiting Jura - Common Questions"
**Count:** 3 questions

#### Q1: How do I get to Jura from Islay?
**Search volume:** 590/month (covered above but worth repeating here)
**Answer:** A small car ferry runs from Port Askaig to Jura, taking 5 minutes. Runs roughly hourly with no booking required for foot passengers - just turn up 10 minutes before departure. Check timetable for last ferry times.

#### Q2: Is Jura worth visiting?
**Answer:** If you want genuine remoteness - yes. One road, one hotel, one pub, 6,000+ red deer to ~200 people. It makes Islay feel busy. Perfect for dramatic landscapes, wildlife, and proper escape. Day trip works, but longer stays let you reach Barnhill (where Orwell wrote 1984) and Corryvreckan whirlpool.

#### Q3: Can I stay on Jura?
**Answer:** Yes - we own Bothan Jura Retreat with four accommodation options (cottage, lodge, cabin, shepherd's hut), each sleeping 2 with hot tubs and sauna under the stars at the foot of the Paps. Consider splitting your trip between both islands. [Visit Bothan Jura →](https://www.bothanjuraretreat.co.uk)

## Content Rules (from Playbook 08-03)

### ✅ DO:
- Keep answers to 2-3 sentences maximum
- Use natural language that matches how people actually search
- Reframe existing content, don't duplicate it verbatim
- Make all Q&As fully visible (no accordions)
- Link to detailed content where relevant
- Ensure answers can stand alone if extracted by AI
- Maximum 6 Q&As per block for scannability

### ❌ DON'T:
- Create a separate /faq page
- Use FAQPage schema (use entity schemas instead)
- Duplicate lists or content that's already on the page
- Write overly long answers (split into multiple Q&As if needed)
- Hide content behind accordions or interactions
- Exceed 6 questions per block

---

## Schema Markup Notes

- **Property pages:** Use Accommodation schema, NOT FAQPage
- **Guide pages:** Use TouristAttraction/Place schema, NOT FAQPage
- **Hub pages:** Use WebPage schema, NOT FAQPage

The Q&A blocks enhance entity pages - they don't replace entity schema. Only use FAQPage schema if you create a standalone FAQ page (which we're not doing).

---

## Quick Win: "Pronunciation FAQ"

The **#2 most searched Islay question** (390/month) is "how to pronounce islay scotland" - and it's **super easy to answer** in one sentence. This should absolutely be on your Getting Here page and possibly homepage too.

**Suggested placement on homepage:** In the hero section or immediately after, add a subtle callout:
> **Visiting Islay?** (Pronounced "EYE-luh" - the 's' is silent)

This tiny addition could capture significant search traffic.

3. **Comparison queries** - "islay vs jura", "islay vs skye"

Let me know if you want me to create FAQ blocks for any of these sub-topics.
